                                  THE
                          MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                          PART III, FIRST HEAD, QUESTION I.
                                                The Method of Initiating a Process

             The first question, then, is what is the suitable method of instituting a process on behalf
       of the faith against witches. In answer to this it must be said that there are three methods
       allowed by Canon Law. The first is when someone accuses a person before a judge of the
       crime of heresy, or of protecting heretics, offering to prove it, and to submit himself to the
       penalty of talion if he fails to prove it. The second method is when someone denounces a
       person, but does not offer to prove it and is not willing to embroil himself in the matter; but
       says that he lays information out of zeal for the faith, or because of a sentence of
       excommunication inflicted by the Ordinary or his Vicar; or because of the temporal
       punishment exacted by the secular Judge upon those who fail to lay information.
             The third method involves an inquisition, that is, when there is no accuser or informer,
       but a general report that there are witches in some town or place; and then the Judge must
       proceed, not at the instance of any party, but simply by the virtue of his office.
             Here it is to be noted that a judge should not readily admit the first method of
       procedure. For one thing, it is not actuated by motives of faith, nor is it very applicable to
       the case of witches, since they commit their deeds in secret. Then, again, it is full of danger
       to the accuser, because of the penalty of talion which he will incur if he fails to prove his
       case. Then, again, it is very litigious.
             Let the process begin with a general citation affixed to the walls of the Parish Church
       or the Town Hall, in the following manner.
             WHEREAS we, the Vicar of such and such Ordinary (or the Judge of such and such
       county), do endeavour with all our might and strive with our whole heart to preserve the
       Christian people entrusted to us in unity and the happiness of the Catholic faith and to keep
       them far removed from every plague of abominable heresy: Therefore we the aforesaid
       Judge to whose office it belongs, to the glory and honour of the worshipful name of JESUS
       Christ and for the exaltation of the Holy Orthodox Faith, and for the putting down of the
       abomination of heresy, especially in all witches in general and in each one severally of
       whatever condition or estate: (Here, if he is an ecclesiastical Judge, let him add a summons
       to all priests and dignitaries of the Church in that town and for a distance of two miles about
       it, who have knowledge of this notice. And he shall add) By the authority which we exercise
       in this district, and in virtue of holy obedience and under pain of excommunication, we
       direct, command, require, and admonish that within the space of twelve days (Here the
       secular Judge shall command in his own manner under pain of penalties suitable to his
       office), the first four of which shall stand for the first warning, the second for the second,
       and the third for the third warning; and we give this treble canonical warning that if anyone
       know, see, or have heard that any person is reported to be a heretic or a witch, or of any is
       suspected especially of such practices as cause injury to men, cattle, or the fruits of the
       earth, to the loss of the State. But if any do not obey these aforesaid commands and
       admonitions by revealing such matters within the term fixed, let him know (Here the
       ecclesiastical Judge shall add) that he is cut off by the sword of excommunication (The
       secular Judge shall add the temporal punishments). Which sentence of excommunication we
       impose as from this time by this writing upon all and several who thus stubbornly set at
       naught these our canonical warnings aforesaid, and our requirement of their obedience,
       reserving to ourselves alone the absolution of such sentence (The secular Judge shall
       conclude in this manner). Given, etc.
             Note also that in the case of the second method the following caution should be
       observed. For it has been said that the second method of procedure and of instituting a
       process on behalf of the faith is by means of an information, where the informer does not
       offer to prove his statement and is not ready to be embroiled in the case, but only speaks
       because of a sentence of excommunication, or out of zeal for the faith and for the good of
       the State. Therefore the secular Judge must specify in his general citation or warning
       aforesaid, that none should think that he will become liable to a penalty even if he fails to
       proved his words; since he comes forward not as an accuser but as an informer.
             And then, since several will appear to lay information before the Judge, he ought to
       take care to proceed in the following manner. First, let him have a Notary and two honest
       persons, either clerics or laymen; or if a Notary is not to be procured, then let there be two
       suitable men in the place of the Notary. For this is dealt with in the c. ut officium, § uerum,
       lib. 6, where it is said: But because it is expedient to proceed with great caution in the trial
       of a grave crime, that no error may be committed in imposing upon the guilty a deservedly
       severe punishment; we desire and command that, in the examination of the witnesses
       necessary in such a charge, you shall have two religious and discreet persons, either clerics
       or laymen.
             It goes on to say: In the presence of these persons the depositions of the witnesses shall
       be faithfully written down by a public official if one is obtainable, or, if not, by two suitable
       men. Note therefore that, having these persons, the Judge shall order the informer to lay his
       information in writing, or at least give it clearly by word of mouth. And then the Notary or
       the Judge shall begin to process in the following manner.
                                       In the Name of the Lord. Amen.
             In the year of Our Lord —, on the — day of the — month, in the presence of me the
       Notary and of the witnesses subscribed, N. of the town of — in the Diocese of —, as above,
       appeared in the person at — before the honourable Judge, and offered him a schedule to the
       following effect.
             (Here shall follow the schedule in its entirety. But if he has not deposed in writing buy
       by word of mouth, it shall continue thus.)
             He appeared, etc. and laid information to the Judge that N. of the town or parish of —
       in the Diocese of — had said and asserted that he knew how to perform or had actually done
       certain injuries to the deponent or to other persons.
             After this, he shall immediately make the deponent take the oath in the usual manner,
       either on the four Gospels of God, or on the Cross, raising three fingers and depressing two
       in witness of the Holy Trinity and of the damnation of his soul and body, that he will speak
       the truth in his depositions. And when the oath has been sworn, he shall question him as to
       how he knows that his depositions are true, and whether he saw or heard that to which he
       swears. And if he says that he has seen anything, as, for example, that the accused was
       present at such a time of tempest, or that he had touched an animal, or had entered a stable,
       the Judge shall ask when he saw him, and where, and how often, and in what manner, and
       who were present. If he says that he did not see it, but heard of it, he shall ask him from
       whom he heart it, where, when, and how often, and in whose presence, making separate
       articles of each of the several points above mentioned. And the Notary or scribe shall set
       down a record of them immediately after the aforesaid denunciation; and it shall continue
       thus:
              This denunciation, as we have said, having been made, the Inquisitor himself did at
       once cause him to swear as above on the four Gospels, etc. that he was speaking the truth in
       his depositions, and did ask him how and why he knew or suspected that he what he said
       was true. He did make answer either that he saw, or that he heard. The Inquisitor did then
       ask him where he saw or heard this; and he answered on the — day of the — month in the
       year — in the town or parish of —. He asked him how often he saw or heard it, etc. And
       separate articles shall be made, and the whole set down in process, as has been said. And
       particularly he shall be asked who shared or could share in his knowledge of the case.
              When all this has been done, he shall finally be asked whether he lays his information
       out of ill-will, hatred, or rancour; or if he has omitted anything through favour or love; of if
       he has been requested or suborned to lay information.
              Finally, he shall be enjoined, by virtue of his oath, to keep secret whatever he has said
       there, or whatever the Judge has said to him; and the whole process shall be set down in
       writing. And when all this is completed, it shall be set down a little lower as follows. This
       was done at such a place on the — day of the — month in the year —, in the presence of me
       the Notary or scribe together with those associated with me in the duty of writing, and of
       such and such witnesses summoned and interrogated.
              The third method of beginning a process is the commonest and most usual one, because
       it is secret, and no accuser or informer has to appear. But when there is a general report of
       witchcraft in some town or parish, because of this report the Judge may proceed without a
       general citation or admonition as above, since the noise of that report comes often to his
       ears; and then again he can begin a process in the presence of the persons, as we have said
       before.
                                       In the Name of the Lord. Amen.
             In the year of Our Lord —, on the — day of the — month, to the ears of such and such
       official or judge there came a persistent public report and rumour that N. of the town or
       parish of — did or said such and such a thing savouring of witchcraft, against the faith and
       the common good of the State.
             And the whole shall be set down according to the common report. And a little lower:
             The case was heard on the — day of the — month in the year —, in the presence of me
       the Notary of such and such authority, or of such and such a scribe, and of such and such
       witnesses who were called and interrogated.
             But before we proceed to the second Head, which deals with the method of conducting
       this sort of process, we must first say something of the witnesses who are to be examined, as
       to how many they should be, and what should be their condition.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                                   THE
                           MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                          PART III, FIRST HEAD, QUESTION II.
                                                     Of the Number of Witnesses

             Since we have said that in the second method the evidence of the witnesses is to be
       written down, it is necessary to know how many witnesses there should be, and of what
       condition. The question is whether a Judge may lawfully convict any person of the heresy of
       witchcraft on the evidence of two legitimate witnesses whose evidence is entirely
       concordant, or whether more than two are necessary. And we say that the evidence of
       witnesses is not entirely concordant when it is only partially so; that is, when two witnesses
       differ in their accounts, but agree in the substance or effect: as when one says “She
       bewitched my cow,” and the other says, “She bewitched my child,” but they agree as to the
       fact of witchcraft.
             But here we are concerned with the case of two witnesses being in entire, not partial,
       agreement. And the answer is that, although two witnesses seem to be enough to satisfy the
       rigour of law (for the rule is that that which is sworn to by two or three is taken for the
       truth); yet in a charge of this kind two witnesses do not seem sufficient to ensure an
       equitable judgement, on account of the heinousness of the crime in question. For the proof
       of an accusation ought to be clearer than daylight; and especially ought this to be so in the
       case of the grave charge of heresy.
             But it may be said that very little proof is required in a charge of this nature, since it
       takes very little argument to expose a person's guilt; for it is said in the Canon de Haereticis,
       lib. II, that a man makes himself a heretic if in the least of his opinions he wanders from the
       teaching and the path of the Catholic religion. We answer that this is true enough with
       reference to the presumption that a person is a heretic, but not as regards a condemnation.
       For in a charge of this sort the usual order of judicial procedure is cut short, since the
       defendant does not see the witnesses take the oath, nor are they made known to him,
       because this might expose them to grave danger; therefore, according to the statute, the
       prisoner is not permitted to know who are his accusers. But the Judge himself must by virtue
       of his office, inquire into any personal enmity felt by the witnesses towards the prisoner; and
       such witnesses cannot be allowed, as will be shown later. And when the witnesses give
       confused evidence on account of something lying on their conscience, the Judge is
       empowered to put them through a second interrogatory. For the less opportunity the prisoner
       has to defend himself, the more carefully and diligently should the Judge conduct his
       inquiry.
             Therefore, although there are two legitimate and concordant witnesses against a person,
       even so I do not allow that this would be sufficient warrant for a Judge to condemn a person
       on so great a charge; but if the prisoner is the subject of an evil report, a period should be set
       for his purgation; and if he is under strong suspicion on account of the evidence of two
       witnesses, the Judge should make him abjure the heresy, or question him, or defer his
       sentence. For it does not seem just to condemn a man of good name on so great a charge on
       the evidence of only two witnesses, though the case is otherwise with a person of bad
       reputation. This matter is fully dealt with in the Canon Law of heretics, where it is set down
       that the Bishop shall cause three or more men of good standing to give evidence on oath to
       speak the truth as to whether they have any knowledge of the existence of heretics in such a
       parish.
             Again it may be asked whether the Judge can justly condemn a person of such heresy
       only on the evidence of witnesses who in some respects differ in their evidence, or merely
       on the strength of a general accusation. We answer that he cannot do so on either of the
       above grounds. Especially since the proofs of a charge ought, as we have said, to be clearer
       than daylight; and in this particular charge no one is to be condemned on merely
       presumptive evidence. Therefore in the case of a prisoner who is the subject of a general
       accusation, a period of purgation shall be set for him; and in the case of one who is under
       strong suspicion arising from the evidence of witnesses, he shall be made to abjure his
       heresy. But when, in spite of certain discrepancies, the witnesses agree in the main facts,
       then the matter shall rest with the Judge's discretion; and indirectly the question arises how
       often the witnesses can be examined.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                                        PART III, FIRST HEAD, QUESTION III.
                                 Of the Solemn Adjuration and Re-examination of Witnesses

             But it may be asked whether the Judge can compel witnesses to sweat an oath to tell the
       truth in a case concerning the Faith or witches, of if he can examine them many times. We
       answer that he can do so, especially an ecclesiastical Judge, and that in ecclesiastical cases
       witnesses can be compelled to speak the truth, and this on oath, since otherwise their
       evidence would not be valid. For the Canon Law says: The Archbishop or Bishop may make
       a circuit of the parish in which it is rumoured that there are heretics, and compel three or
       more men of good repute, or even, if it seems good to him, the whole neighbourhood, to
       give evidence. And if any through damnable obstinacy stubbornly refuse to take the oath,
       they shall on that account be considered as heretics.
             And that the witnesses can be examined several times is shown by the Canon, where it
       says that, when the witnesses have given their evidence in a confused manner, or appear to
       have withheld part of their knowledge for some reason, the Judge must take care to examine
       them afresh; for he may legally do so.

                                  THE
                          MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                         PART III, FIRST HEAD, QUESTION IV.
                                           Of the Quality and Condition of Witnesses

             Note that persons under a sentence of excommunication, associates and accomplices in
       the crime, notorious evildoers and criminals, or servants giving evidence against their
       masters, are admitted as witnesses in a case concerning the Faith. And just as a heretic may
       give evidence against a heretic, so may a witch against a witch; but this only in default of
       other proofs, and such evidence can only be admitted for the prosecution and not for the
       defence: this is true also of the evidence of the prisoner's wife, sons and kindred; for the
       evidence of such has more weight in proving a charge than in disproving it.
             This is made clear in the c. in fidei de haer., where it says: As a protection of the faith
       we allow that in a case of inquiry into the sin of heresy, persons under excommunication and
       partners and accomplices in the crime shall be admitted as witnesses, in default of other
       proofs against heretics and their patrons, protectors and defenders; provided that it appears
       probably both from the number of the witnesses and of those against whom they give
       evidence, and from other cicumstances, that they are not giving false testimony.
             The case of evidence given by perjurers, when it is presumed that they are speaking out
       of zeal for the faith, is deal with in the Canon c. accusatus, § licet, where it says that the
       evidence of perjurers, after they have repented, is admissable; and it goes on to say: If it
       manifestly appears that they do not speak in a spirit of levity, or from motives of enmity, or
       by reason of a bribe, but purely out of zeal for the orthodox faith, wishing to correct what
       they have said, or to reveal something about which they had kept silence, in defence of the
       faith, their testimony shell be as valid as that of anyone else, provided that there is no other
       obection to it.
             And it is clear from the same chapter of the Canon that the testimony of men or low
       repute and criminals, and of servants against their masters, is admitted; for it says: So great
       is the plague of heresy that, in an action involving this crime, even servants are admitted as
       witnesses against their masters, and any criminal evildoer may give evidence against any
       person soever.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                                  THE
                          MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                          PART III, FIRST HEAD, QUESTION V.
                                   Whether Mortal Enemies may be Admitted as Witnesses

              But if it is asked whether the Judge can admit the mortal enemies of the prisoner to
       give evidence against him in such a case, we answer that he cannot; for the same chapter of
       the Canon says: You must not understand that in this kind of charge a mortal personal
       enemy may be admitted to give evidence. Henry of Segusio also makes this quite clear. But
       it is mortal enemies that are spoken of; and it is to be noted that a witness is not necessarily
       to be disqualified because of every sort of enmity. And a mortal enmity is constituted by the
       following circumstances: when there is a death feud or vendetta between the parties, or
       when there has been an attempted homicide, or some serious wound or injury which
       manifestly shows that there is mortal hatred on the part of the witness against the prisoner,
       And in such a case it is presumed that, just as the witness has tried to inflict temporal death
       on the prisoner by wounding him, so he will also be willing to effect his object by accusing
       him of heresy; and just as he wished to take away his life, so he would be willing to take
       away his good name. Therefore the evidence of such mortal enemies is justly disqualified.
              But there are other serious degrees of enmity (for women are easily provoked to
       hatred), which need not totally disqualify a witness, although they render his evidence very
       doubtful, so that full credence cannot be placed in his words unless they are substantiated by
       independent proofs, and other witnesses supply an indubitable proof of them. For the Judge
       must ask the prisoner whether he thinks that he has any enemy who would dare to accuse
       him of that crime out of hatred, so that he might compass his death; and if he says that he
       has, he shall ask who that person is; and then the Judge shall take note whether the person
       named as being likely to give evidence from motives of malice has actually done so. And if
       it is found that this is the case, and the Judge has learned from trustworthy men the cause of
       that enmity, and if the evidence in question is not substantiated by other proofs and the
       words of other witnesses, then he may safely reject such evidence. But if the prisoner says
       that he hopes he has no such enemy, but admits that he has had quarrels with women; or if
       he says that he has an enemy, but names someone who, perhaps, has not given evidence, in
       that case, even if other witnesses say that such a person has given evidence from motives of
       enmity, the Judge must not reject his evidence, but admit it together with the other proofs.
              There are many who are not sufficiently careful and circumspect, and consider that the
       depositions of such quarrelsome women should be altogether rejected, saying that no faith
       can be placed in them, since they are nearly always actuated by motives of hatred. Such men
       are ignorant of the subtlety and precautions of magistrates, and speak and judge like men
       who are colour-blind. But these precautions are dealt with in Questions XI and XII.

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                       PART III, SECOND HEAD, QUESTION VI.
How the Trial is to be Proceeded with and Continued. And how the Witnesses are to be Examined in the
       Presence of Four Other Persons, and how the Accused is to be Questioned in Two Ways

             In considering the method of proceeding with a trial of a witch in the cause of faith, it
       must first be noted that such cases must be conducted in the simplest and most summary
       manner, without the arguments and contentions of advocates.
             This is explained in the Canon as follows: It often happens that we institute a criminal
       process, and order it to be conducted in a simple straightforward manner without the legal
       quibbles and contentions which are introduced in other cases. Now much doubt had been
       experienced as to the meaning of these words, and as to exactly in what manner such cases
       should be conducted; but we, desiring as far as possible to remove all doubt on the matter,
       sanction the following procedure once and for all as valid: The Judge to whom we commit
       such a case need not require any writ, or demand that the action should be contested; he may
       conduct the case on holidays for the sake of the convenience of the public, he should shorten
       the conduct of the case as much as he can by disallowing all dilatory exceptions, appeals and
       obstructions, the impertinent contentions of pleaders and advocates, and the quarrels of
       witnesses, and by restraining the superflous number of witnesses; but not in such a way as to
       neglect the necessary proofs; and we do not mean by this that he should omit the citation of
       and swearing of witnesses to tell and not to hide the truth.
             And since, as we have shown, the process is to be conducted in a simple manner, and it
       is initiated either at the instance of an accuser, or of an informer actuated by zeal, or by
       reason of a general outcry and rumour; therefore the Judge should try to avoid the first
       method of beginning the action, namely, at the instance of an accusing party. For the deeds
       of witches in conjunction with devils are done in secret, and the accuser cannot in this case,
       as in others, have definite evidence by which he can make his statements good; therefore the
       Judge ought to advise the accuser to set aside his formal accusation and to speak rather as an
       informer, because of the grave danger that is incurred by an accuser. And so he can proceed
       in the second manner, which is commonly used, and likewise in the third manner, in which
       the process is begun not at the instance of any party.
             It is to be noted that we have already said that the Judge ought particularly to ask the
       informer who shares or could share in his knowledge of the case. Accordingly the Judge
       should call as witnesses those whom the informer names, who seem to have most
       knowledge of the matter, and their names shall be entered by the scribe. After this the Judge,
       having regard to the fact that the aforesaid denunciation of heresy involves of its very nature
       such a grave charge that it cannot and must not be lightly passed over, since to do so would
       imply an offence to the Divine Majesty and an injury to the Catholic Faith and to the State,
       shell proceed to inform himself and examine the witnesses in the following manner.

                                                      Examination of Witnesses.

             The witness N., of such a place, was called, sworn, and questioned whether he knew N.
       (naming the accused), and answered that he did. Asked how he knew him, he answered that
       he had seen and spoken with him on several occasions, or that they had been comrades (so
       explaining his reason for knowing him). Asked for how long he had known him, he
       answered, for ten or for so many years. Asked concerning his reputation, especially in
       matter concerning the faith, he answered that in his morals he was a good (or bad) man, but
       with regard to his faith, there was a report in such a place that he used certain practices
       contrary to the Faith, as a witch. Asked what was the report, he made answer. Asked
       whether he had seen or heard him doing such things, he again answered accordingly. Asked
       where he had heard him use such words, he answered, in such a place. Asked in whose
       presence, he answered, in the presence of such and such.
             Further, he was asked whether any of the accused's kindred had formerly been burned
       as witches, or had been suspected, and he answered. Asked whether he associated with
       suspected witches, he answered. Asked concerning the manner and reason of the accused's
       alleged words, he answered, for such a reason and in such a manner. Asked whether he
       thought that the prisoner had used those words carelessly, unmeaningly and thoughtlessly,
       or rather with deliberate intention, he answered that he had used them jokingly or in temper,
       or without meaning or believing what he said, or else with deliberate intention.
             Asked further how he could distinguish the accused's motive, he answered that he knew
       it because he had spoken with a laugh.
             This is a matter which must be inquired into very diligently; for very often people use
       words quoting someone else, or merely in temper, or as a test of the opinions of other
       people; although sometimes they are used assertively with definite intention.
             He was further asked whether he made this deposition out of hatred or rancour, or
       whether he had suppressed anything out of favour or love, and he answered, etc. Following
       this, he as enjoined to preserve secrecy. This was done at such a place on such a day in the
       presence of such witnesses called and questioned, and of me the Notary or scribe.
             Here it must always be noted that in such an examination at least five persons must be
       present, namely, the presiding Judge, the witness of informer, the respondent or accused,
       who appears afterwards, and the third is the Notary or scribe: where there is no Notary the
       scribe shall co-opt another honest man, and these two, as has been said, shall perform the
       duties of the Notary; and this is provided for by Apostolic authority, as was shown above,
       that in this kind of action two honest men should perform as it were the duty of witnesses of
       the depositions.
             Also it must be noted that when a witness is called he must also be sworn, that is, he
       must take the oath in the manner we have shown; otherwise he would falsely be described as
       called and sworn.
             In the same way the other witnesses are to be examined. And after this the Judge shall
       decide whether the fact is fully proven; and if not fully, whether there are great indications
       and strong suspicions of its truth. Observe that we do not speak of a light suspicion, arising
       from slight conjectures, but of a persistent report that the accused has worked witchcraft
       upon children or animals, etc. Then, if the Judge fears the escape of the accused, he shall
       cause him or her to be placed in custody; but if he does not fear his escape, he shall have

       him called for examination. But whether or not he places him in custody, he shall first cause
       his house to be searched unexpectedly, and all chests to be opened and all boxes in the
       corners, and all implements of witchcraft which are found to be taken away. And having
       done this, the Judge shall compare together everything of which he has been convicted or
       suspected by the evidence of witnesses, and conduct an interrogatory on them, having with
       him a Notary, etc., as above, and having caused the accused to swear by the four Gospels of
       God to speak the truth concerning both himself and others. And they shall all be written
       down in this following manner.

                    The General Examination of a Witch or Wizard: and it is the First Action.

             The accused N. of such a place was sworn by personally touching the four Gospels of
       God to speak the truth concerning both himself and others, and was then asked whence he
       was and from where he originated. And he answered, from such a place in such a Diocese.
       Asked who were his parents, and whether they were alive or dead, he answered that they
       were alive in such a place, or dead in such a place.
             Asked whether they died a natural death, or were burned, he answered in such a way.
       (Here note that this question is put because, as was shown in the Second Part of this work,
       witches generally offer or devote their own children to devils, and commonly their whole
       progeny is infected; and when the informer has deposed to this effect, and the witch herself
       has denied it, it lays her open to suspicion).
             Asked where he was brought up, and where he chiefly lived, he answered, in such or
       such a place. And if it appears that he has changed abode because, perhaps, his mother or
       any of his kindred was not suspected, and had lived in foreign districts, especially in such
       places as are most frequented by witches, he shall be questioned accordingly.
             Asked why he had moved from his birthplace and gone to live in such or such a place,
       he answered, for such a reason. Asked whether in those said places or elsewhere he had
       heard any talk of witches, as, for example, the stirring up of tempests, the bewitching of
       cattle, the depriving of cows of their milk, or any such matter of which he was accused; if he
       should answer that he had, he must be asked what he had heard, and all that he says must be
       written down. But if he denies it, and says that he has heard nothing, then he must be asked
       whether he believes that there are such things as witches, and that such things as were
       mentioned could be done, as that tempests could be raised or men and animals bewitched.
             Not that for the most part witches deny this at first; and therefore this engenders a
       greater suspicion than if they were to answer that they left it to a superior judgement to say
       whether there were such or not. So if they deny it, they must be questioned as follows: Then
       are they innocently condemned when they are burned? And he or she must answer.

                                            The Particular Examination of the Same.

            Let the Judge take care not to delay the following questions, but to proceed at once
       with them. Let he be asked why the common people fear her, and whether she knows that
       she is defamed and hated, and why she had threatened such a person, saying, “You shall not
       cross me with impunity,” and let her answers be noted.
            Then let he be asked what harm that person had done her, that she should have used

       such words to threaten him with injury. And note that this question is necessary in order to
       arrive at the cause of their enmity, for in the end the accused will allege that the informer
       has spoken out of enmity; but when this is not mortal, but only a womanish quarrel, it is no
       impediment. For this is a common custom of witches, to stir up enmity against themselves
       by some word or action, as, for example, to ask someone to lend them something or else
       they will damage his garden, or something of that sort, in order to make an occasion for
       deeds of witchcraft; and they manifest themselves either in word or in action, since they are
       compelled to do so at the instance of the devils, so that in this way the sins of Judges are
       aggravated while the witch remains unpunished.
             For note that they do not do such things in the presence of others, so that if the informer
       wishes to produce witnesses he cannot do so. Note again that they are spurred on by the
       devils, as we have learned from many witches who have afterwards been burned; so that
       often they have to work witchcraft against their own wills.
             Further, she was asked how the effect could follow from those threats, as that a child or
       animal should so quickly be bewitched, and she answered. Asked, “Why did you say that he
       would never know a day of health, and it was so?” she answered. And if she denies
       everything, let her be asked concerning other bewitchments, alleged by other witnesses,
       upon cattle or children. Asked why she was seen in the fields or in the stable with the cattle,
       and touching them, as is sometimes their custom, she answered.
             Asked why she touched a child, and afterwards it fell sick, she answered. Also she was
       asked what she did in the fields at the time of a tempest, and so with many other matters.
       Again, why, having one or two cows, she had more milk than her neighbours who had four
       or six. Again, let her be asked why she persists in a state of adultery or concubinage; for
       although this is beside the point, yet such questions engender more suspicion than would the
       case with a chaste and honest woman who stood accused.
             And not that she is to be continually questioned as to the depositions which have been
       laid against her, to see whether she always returns the same answers or not. And when this
       examination has been completed, whether her answers have been negative, or affirmative, or
       ambiguous, let them be written down: Executed in such a place, etc., as above.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                      PART III, SECOND HEAD, QUESTION VII.
In Which Various Doubts are Set Forth with Regard to the Foregoing Questions and Negative Answers.
Whether the Accused is to be Imprisoned, and when she is to be considered Manifestly Taken in the Foul
                            Heresy of Witchcraft. This is the Second Action

             It is asked first what is to be done when, as often happens, the accused denies
       everything. We answer that the Judge has three points to consider, namely, her bad
       reputation, the evidence of the fact, and the words of the witnesses; and he must see whether
       all these agree together. And if, as very often is the case, they do not altogether agree
       together, since witches are variously accused of different deeds committed in some village
       or town; but the evidences of the fact are visible to the eye, as that a child has been harmed
       by sorcery, or, more often, a beast has been bewitched or deprived of its milk; and it a
       number of witnesses have come forward whose evidence, even if it show certain
       discrepancies (as that one should say she had bewitched his child, another his beast, and a
       third should merely witness to her reputation, and so with the others), but nevertheless agree
       in the substance of the fact, that is, as to the witchcraft, and that she is suspected of being a
       witch; although those witnesses are not enough to warrant a conviction without the fact of
       the general report, or even with that fact, as was shown above at the end of Question III, yet,
       taken in conjunction with the visible and tangible evidence of the fact, the Judge may, in
       consideration of these three points together, decide that the accused is to be reputed, not as
       strongly or gravely under suspicion (which suspicions will be explained later), but as
       manifestly taken in the heresy of witchcraft; provided, that is, that the witnesses are of a
       suitable condition and have not given evidence out of enmity, and that a sufficient number
       of them, say six or eight or ten, have agreed together under oath. And then, according to the
       Canon Law, he must subject her to punishment, whether she has confessed her crime or not.
       And this is proved as follows.
             For since it is said, that when all three of the above considerations are in agreement,
       then she should be thought to be manifestly taken in heresy, it must not be understood that it
       is necessary for all three to be in agreement, but only that if this is the case the proof is all
       the stronger. For either one instance by itself of the following two circumstances, namely,
       the evidence of the fact and the production of legitimate witnesses, is sufficient to cause a
       person to be reputed as manifestly taken in heresy; and all the more when both these
       considerations are in agreement.
             For when the Jurists ask in how many ways a person may be considered as manifestly
       taken in heresy, we answer that there are three ways, as S. Bernard has explained. This
       matter was treated of above in the First Question at the beginning of this work, namely, the
       evidence of the fact, when a person has publicly preacher heresy. But here we consider the
       evidence of the fact provided by public threats uttered by the accused, as when she said,
       “You shall have no healthy days,” or some such thing, and the threatened effect has
       followed. The other two ways are the legitimate proof of the case by witnesses, and thirdly
       by her own confession. Therefore, if each of these singly is sufficient to cause a person to be
       manifestly suspected, how much more is this the case when the reputation of the accused,
       the evidence of the fact, and the depositions of witnesses all together point to the same
       conclusion. It is true that S. Bernard speaks of an evident fact, and we here speak of the
       evidence of the fact; but this is because the devil does not work openly, but secretly.
       Therefore the injuries and the instruments of witchcraft which are found constitute the
       evidence of the fact. And whereas in other heresies an evident fact is alone sufficient, here
       we join three proofs together.
             Secondly, it is thus proved that a person so taken is to be punished according to the
       law, even though she denies the accusation. For a person taken on the evidence of the fact,
       or on the depositions of witnesses, either confesses the crime or does not. If he confesses
       and is impenitent, he is to be handed over to the secular courts to suffer the extreme penalty,
       according to the chapter ad abolendam, or he is to be imprisoned for life, according to the
       chapter excommunicamus. But if he does not confess, and stoutly maintains his denial, he is
       to be delivered as an impenitent to the power of the Civil Court to be punished in a fitting
       manner, as Henry of Segusio shows in his Summa, where he treats of the manner of
       proceeding against heretics.
             It is therefore concluded that it is most just if the Judge proceeds in that manner with
       his questions and the depositions of witnesses, since, as has been said, he can in a case
       concerning the Faith conduct matters quite plainly and in a short and summary manner; and
       it is meet that he should consign the accused to prison for a time, or for several years, in case
       perhaps, being depressed after a year of the squalor of prison, she may confess her crimes.
             But, lest it should seem that he arrives at his sentence precipitately, and to show that he
       proceeds with all equity, let us inquire into what should next be done.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                       PART III, SECOND HEAD, QUESTION VIII.
Which Follows from the Preceding Question, Whether the Witch is to be Imprisoned, and of the Method
                        of Taking her. This is the Third Action of the Judge

             It is asked whether, after she has denied the accusation, the witch ought to be kept in
       custody in prison, when the three aforesaid conditions, namely, her reputation, the evidence
       of the fact, and the depositions of witnesses, are in agreement; or whether she should be
       dismissed with the security of sureties, so that she may again be called and questioned. As to
       this question there are three opinions.
             First, it is the opinion of some that she should be sent to prison, and that by no means
       ought she to be dismissed under bond; and they hold this opinion on the strength of the
       reasoning brought forward in the preceding question, namely, that she is to be considered as
       manifestly guilty when all those three considerations are in agreement.
             Others, again, think that before she is imprisoned she may be dismissed with the
       safeguard of sureties; so that if she makes her escape, she can then be considered as
       convicted. But after she has been imprisoned because of her negative answers, she is not to
       be released under any safeguard or condition of bail, that is, when those three considerations
       noted above are in agreement; because in that case she could not subsequently be sentenced
       and punished by death; and this, they say, is the general custom.
             The third opinion is that no definite rule can be given, but that it must be left to the
       Judge to act in accordance with the gravity of the matter as shown by the testimony of the
       witnesses, the reputation of the accused, and the evidence as to the fact, and the extent to
       which these three agree with each other; and that he should follow the custom of the
       country. And they who hold this opinion conclude by saying that if reputable and
       responsible sureties are not to be procured, and the accused is suspected of contemplating
       flight, she should then be cast into prison. And this third opinion seems to be the most
       reasonable, as long as the correct procedure if observed; and this consists in three things.
             First, that her house should be searched as thoroughly as possible, in all holes and
       corners and chests, top and bottom; and if she is a noted witch, then without doubt, unless
       she has previously hidden them, there will be found various instruments of witchcraft, as we
       have shown above.
             Secondly, if she has a maid-servant or companions, that she or they should be shut up
       by themselves; for though they are not accused, yet it is presumed that none of the accused's
       secrets are hidden from them.
             Thirdly, in taking her, if she be taken in her own house, let her not be given time to go
       into her room; for they are wont to secure in this way, and bring away with them, some
       object or power of witchcraft which procures them the faculty of keeping silent under
       examination.
             This gives rise to the question whether the method employed by some to capture a
       witch is lawful, namely, that she should be lifted from the ground by the officers, and
       carried out in a basket or on a plank of wood so that she cannot again touch the ground. This
       can be answered by the opinion of the Canonists and of certain Theologians, that this is
       lawful in three respects. First, because, as is shown in the introductory question of this Third
       Part, it is clear from the opinion of many authorities, and especially of such Doctors as no
       one would dare to dispute, as Duns Scotus, Henry of Segusio and Godfrey of Fontaines, that
       it is lawful to oppose vanity with vanity. Also we know from experience and the confessions
       of witches that when they are taken in this manner they more often lose the power of
       keeping silence under examination: indeed many who have been about to be burned have
       asked that they might be allowed at least to touch the ground with one foot; and when this
       has been asked why they made such a request, they have answered that if they had touched
       the ground they would have liberated themselves, striking many other people dead with
       lightning.
              The second reason is this. It was manifestly shown in the Second Part of this work that
       a witch loses all her power when she falls into the hands of public justice, that is, with
       regard to the past; but with regard to the future, unless she receives from the devil fresh
       powers of keeping silent, she will confess all her crimes. Therefore let us say with S. Paul:
       Whatsoever we do in word or deed, let all be done in the name of the Lord JESUS Christ.
       And if the witch be innocent, this form of capture will not harm her.
              Thirdly, according to the Doctors it is lawful to counteract witchcraft by vain means;
       for they all agree as to this, though they are at variance over the question as to when those
       vain means may also be unlawful. Therefore when Henry of Segusio says that it is lawful to
       oppose vanity with vanity, this is explained as meaning that he speaks of vain means, not of
       unlawful means. All the more, then, is it lawful to obstruct witchcraft; and it is this
       obstruction which is referred to here, and not any unlawful practice.
              Let the Judge note also that there are two sorts of imprisonment; one being a
       punishment inflicted upon criminals, but the other only a matter of custody in the house of
       detention. And these two sorts are noted in the chapter multorum querela; therefore she
       ought at least to be placed in custody. But if it is only a slight matter of which she is
       accused, and she is not of bad reputation, and there is no evidence of her work upon children
       or animals, then she may be sent back to her house. But because she has certainly associated
       with witches and knows their secrets, she must give sureties; and if she cannot do so, she
       must be bound by oaths and penalties not to go out of her house unless she is summoned.
       But her servants and domestics, of whom we spoke above, must be kept in custody, yet not
       punished.

            “House should be searched.” Thus in the famouse witch trial of Dame Alive Kyteler and
        her coven before the Bishop of Ossory in 1324, John le Poer, the husband of Dame Alice,
        deposed that in her closet were discovered mysterious vials and elixirs, strange necromantic
        instruments and ghastly relics of mortality which she used in her horrid craft. Holinshed in
        his “Chronicle of Ireland” (London, 1587, p. 93), sub anno 1323, has: “In rifling the closet
        of the ladie, they found a wafer of sacramental bread, having the divels name stamped
        thereon in steed of JESUS Christ, and a pipe of ointment, wherewith she greased a staffe,
        upon whish she ambled and gallopped through thicke and thin when and in what manner
        she listed.” See my “Geography of Witchcraft,” Chap. II, pp. 85-91.

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                       PART III, SECOND HEAD, QUESTION IX.
What is to be done after the Arrest, and whether the Names of the Witnesses should be made Known to
                                the Accused. This is the Fourth Action

             THERE are two matters to be attended to after the arrest, but it is left to the Judge
       which shall be taken first; namely, the question of allowing the accused to be defended, and
       whether she should be examined in the place of torture, though not necessarily in order that
       she should be tortured. The first is only allowed when a direct request is made; the second
       only when her servants and companions, if she has any, have first been examined in the
       house.
             But let us proceed in the order as above. If the accused says that she is innocent and
       falsely accused, and that she wishes to see and hear her accusers, then it is a sign that she is
       asking to defend herself. But it is an open question whether the Judge is bound to make the
       deponents known to her and bring them to confront her face to face. For here let the Judge
       take note that he is not bound either to publish the names of the deponents or to bring them
       before the accused, unless they themselves should freely and willingly offer to come before
       the accused and lay their depositions in her presence And it is by reason of the danger
       incurred by the deponents that the Judge is not bound to do this. For although different
       Popes have had different opinions on this matter, none of them has ever said that in such a
       case the Judge is bound to make known to the accused the names of the informers or
       accusers (but here we are not dealing with the case of an accuser). On the contrary, some
       have thought that in no case ought he to do so, while others have thought that he should in
       certain circumstances.
             But, finally, Bonifice VIII decreed as follows: If in a case of heresy it appear to the
       Bishop or Inquisitor that grave danger would be incurred by the witnesses of informers on
       account of the powers of the persons against whom they lay their depositions, should their
       names be published, he shall not publish them. But if there is no danger, their names shall be
       published just as in other cases.
             Here it is to be noted that this refers not only to a Bishop or Inquisitor, but to any Judge
       conducting a case against witches with the consent of the Inquisitor or Bishop; for, as was
       shown in the introductory Question, they can depute their duties to a Judge. So that any such
       Judge, even if he be secular, has the authority of the Pope, and not only of the Emperor.
             Also a careful Judge will take notice of the powers of the accused persons; for these are
       of three kinds, namely, the power of birth and family, the power of riches, and the power of
       malice. And the last of these is more to be feared than the other two, since it threatens more
       danger to the witnesses if their names are made known to the accused. The reason for this is
       that it is more dangerous to make known the names of the witnesses to an accused person
       who is poor, because such a person has many evil accomplices, such as outlaws and
       homicides, associated with him, who venture nothing but their own persons, which is not the
       case with anyone who is nobly born or rich, and abounding in temporal possessions. And the
       kind of danger which is to be feared is explained by Pope John XXII as the death of cutting
       off of themselves or their children or kindred, or the wasting of their substance, or some
       such matter.
             Further, let the Judge take notice that, as he acts in this matter with the authority of the
       Supreme Pontiff and the permission of the Ordinary, both he himself and all who are
       associated with him at the depositions, or afterwards at the pronouncing of the sentence,
       must keep the names of the witnesses secret, under pain of excommunication. And it is in
       the power of the Bishop thus to punish him or them if they do otherwise. Therefore he
       should very implicitly warn them not to reveal the name from the very beginning of the
       process.
             Wherefore the above decrees of Pope Bonifice VIII goes on to say: And that the danger
       to those accusers and witnesses may be the more effectively met, and the inquiry conducted
       more cautiously, we permit, by the authority of this statute, that the Bishop or Inquisitors
       (or, as we have said, the Judge) shall forbid all those who are concerned in the inquiry to
       reveal without their permission any secrets which they have learned from the Bishop or
       Inquisitors, under pain of excommunication, which they may incur by violating such secrets.
             It is further to be noted that just as it is a punishable offence to publish the names of
       witnesses indiscreetly, so also it is to conceal them without good reason from, for instance,
       such people as have a right to know them, such as the lawyers and assessors whose opinion
       is to be sought in proceeding to the sentence; in the same way the names must not be
       concealed when it is possible to publish them without risk of any danger to the witnesses.
       On this subject the above decree speaks as follows, towards the end: We command that in
       all cases the Bishop or Inquisitors shall take especial care not to suppress the names of the
       witnesses as if there were danger to them when there is perfect security, not conversely to
       decide to publish them when there is some danger threatened, the decision in this matter
       resting with their own conscience and discretion. And it has been written in comment on
       these words: Whoever you are who are a Judge in such a case, mark those words well, for
       they do not refer to a slight risk but to a grave danger; therefore do not deprive a prisoner of
       his legal rights without very good cause, for this cannot but be an offence to Almighty God.
             The reader must note that all the process which we have already described, and all that
       we have yet to describe, up to the methods of passing sentence (except the death sentence),
       which it is in the province of the ecclesiastical Judge to conduct, can also, with the consent
       of the Diocesans, be conducted by a secular Judge. Therefore the reader need find no
       difficulty in the fact that the above Decree speaks of an ecclesiastical and not a secular
       Judge; for the latter can take his method of inflicting the death sentence from that of the
       Ordinary in passing sentence of penance.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

            “Bonifice VIII.” Benedetto Gaetani, born at Anagni about 1235; elected Pope, 24
        December, 1294; died at Rome, 11 October, 1303. He was one of the most eminent
        canonists of his age, and as Supreme Pontiff enriched legislation by the promulgation (Bull
        “Sacrosanctae,” 1298) of a large number of his own constitutions and those of his
        predecessors since 1234, when Gregory IX issued his five books of Decretals. In reference
        to this, the collection of Bonifice VIII is known as “Liber Sixtus,” i.e. of Pontifical
        Constitutions.

                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                        PART III, SECOND HEAD, QUESTION X.
What Kind of Defence may be Allowed, and of the Appointment of an Advocate. This is the Fifth Action

             IF, therefore, the accused asked to be defended, how can this be admitted when the
       names of the witnesses are kept altogether secret? It is to be said that three considerations
       are to be observed in admitting any defence. First, that an Advocate shall be allotted to the
       accused. Second, that the names of the witnesses shall not be made known to the Advocate,
       even under an oath of secrecy, but that he shall be informed of everything contained in the
       depositions. Third, the accused shall as far as possible be given the benefit of every doubt,
       provided that this involves no scandal to the faith nor is in any way detrimental to justice, as
       will be shown. And in like manner the prisoner’s procurator shall have full access to the
       whole process, only the names of the witnesses and deponents being suppressed; and the
       Advocate can act also in the name of procurator.
             As to the first of these points: it should be noted that an Advocate is not to be appointed
       at the desire of the accused, as if he may choose which Advocate he will have; but the Judge
       must take great care to appoint neither a litigious nor an evil-minded man, nor yet one who
       is easily bribed (as many are), but rather an honourable man to whom no sort of suspicion
       attaches.
             And the Judge ought to note four points, and if the Advocate be found to conform to
       them, he shall be allowed to plead, but not otherwise. For first of all the Advocate must
       examine the nature of the case, and then if he finds it a just one he may undertake it, but if
       he finds it unjust he must refuse it; and he must be very careful not to undertake an unjust or
       desperate case. But if he has unwittingly accepted the brief, together with a fee, from
       someone who wishes to do him an injury, but discovers during the process that the case is
       hopeless, then he must signify to his client (that is, the accused) that he abandons the case,
       and must return the fee which he has received. This is the opinion of Godfrey of Fontaines,
       which is wholly in conformity with the Canon de jud. i, rem non novam. But Henry of
       Segusio holds an opposite view concerning the return of the fee in a case in which the
       Advocate has worked very hard. Consequently if an Advocate has wittingly undertaken to
       defend a prisoner whom he knows to be guilty, he shall be liable for the costs and expenses
       (de admin. tut. i, non tamen est ignotum).
             The second point to be observed is that in his pleading he should conduct himself
       properly in three respects. First, his behaviour must be modest and free from prolixity or
       pretentious oratory. Secondly, he must abide by the truth, not bringing forward any
       fallacious arguments or reasoning, or calling false witnesses, or introducing legal quirks and
       quibbles if he be a skilled lawyer, or bringing counter-accusations; especially in cases of this
       sort, which must be conducted as simply and summarily as possible. Thirdly, his fee must be
       regulated by the usual practice of the district.
             But to return to our point; the Judge must make the above conditions clear to the
       Advocate, and finally admonish him not to incur the charge of defending heresy, which
       would make him liable to excommunication.
             And it is not a valid argument for him to say to the Judge that he is not defending the
       error, but the person. For he must not by any means so conduct his defence as to prevent the
       case from being conducted in a plain and summary manner, and he would be doing so if he
       introduced any complications or appeals into it; all which things are disallowed together.
       For it is granted that he does not defend the error; for in that case he would be more
       damnably guilty than the witches themselves, and rather a heresiarch than a heretical wizard.
       Nevertheless, if he unduly defends a person already suspect of heresy, he makes himself as
       it were a patron of that heresy, and lays himself under not only a light but a strong suspicion,
       in accordance with the manner of his defence; and ought publicly to abjure that heresy
       before the Bishop.
             We have put this matter at some length, and it is not to be neglected by the Judge,
       because much danger may arise from an improper conducting of the defence by an
       Advocate or Procurator. Therefore, when there is any objection to the Advocate, the Judge
       must dispense with him and proceed in accordance with the facts and the proofs. But when
       the Advocate for the accused is not open to any objection, but is a zealous man and lover of
       justice, then the Judge may reveal to him the names of the witnesses, under an oath of
       secrecy.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                       PART III, SECOND HEAD, QUESTION XI.
What Course the Advocate should Adopt when the Names of the Witnesses are not Revealed to him. Ths
                                         Sixth Action

            BUT it may be asked: What, then, should the Advocate acting a Procurator for the
       accused do, when the names of the witnesses are withheld from both himself and his client,
       although the accused earnestly desires that they should be made known? We answer that he
       should obtain information from the Judge on every point of the accusation, which must be
       given to him at his request, only the names of the witnesses being suppressed; and with this
       information he should approach the accused and, if the matter involves a very grave charge,
       exhort him to exercise all the patience which he can.
            And if the accused again and again insists that she should know the names of the
       witnesses against her, he can answer her as follows: You can guess from the charges which
       are made against you who are the witnesses. For the child or beast of so and so has been
       bewitched; or to such a woman or man, because they refused to lend you something for
       which you asked, you said, "You shall know that it would have been better to have agreed to
       my request," and they bear witness that in consequence of your words the person was
       suddenly taken ill; and facts are stronger evidence than words. And you know that you have
       a bad reputation, and have for a long time been suspected of casting spells upon and injuring
       many men. And talking in this manner, he may finally induce her to enter a plea that they
       had borne witness against her from motives of hatred; or to say, "I confess that I did say so,
       but not with any intent to do harm."
            Therefore the Advocate must first lay before the Judge and his assessors this plea of
       personal enmity, and the Judge must inquire into it. And if it should be found to be a case of
       mortal enmity, as that there has been some attempted or accomplished murder committed by
       the husbands or kindred of the parties, or that someone of one party has been charged with a
       crime by someone of the other party, so that he fell into the hands of public justice, or that
       serious wounds have resulted from quarrels and brawls between them; then the upright and
       careful Judge will consult with his assessors whether the accused of the deponent was the
       aggravating party. For if, for example, the husband or friends of the accused have unjustly
       oppressed the friends of the deponent, then if there is no evidence of the fact that children or
       animals or men have been bewitched, and if there are no other witnesses, and the accused is
       not even commonly suspected of witchcraft, in that case it is presumed that the depositions
       were laid against her from motives of vengeance, and she is to be discharged as innocent
       and freely dismissed, after having been duly cautioned against seeking to avenge herself, in
       the manner which is usually used by Judges.
            The following case may be put. Katharina’s child, or she herself, is bewitched, or she
       has suffered much loss of her cattle; and she suspects the accused because her husband or
       brothers had previously brought on an unjust accusation against her own husband or brother.
       Here the cause of enmity is twofold on the part of the deponent, having its root both in her
       own bewitchment and in the unjust accusation brought against her husband or brother. Then
       ought her deposition to be rejected or not? From one point of view it seems that it should,
       because she is actuated by enmity; from another point of view it should not, because there is
       the evidence of the fact in her bewitchment.
             We answer that if in this case there are no other deponents, and the accused is not even
       under common suspicion, then her depositions cannot be allowed, but must be rejected; but
       if the accused is rendered suspect, and if the disease is not due to natural causes but to
       witchcraft (and we shall show later how this can be distinguished), she is to be subjected to
       a canonical purgation.
             If it be asked further whether the other deponents must bear witness to the evidence of
       the fact as experienced by themselves or others, or only to the public reputation of the
       accused; we answer that, if they give evidence of the fact, so much the better. But if they
       only give evidence as to her general character, and the matter stands so, then, although the
       Judge must reject that deponent on the grounds of personal enmity, yet he shall take the
       evidence of the fact, and of her bad reputation given by the other witnesses, as proof that the
       accused must be strongly suspect, and on these grounds he can sentence her to a threefold
       punishment: namely, to a canonical purgation because of her reputation; or to an abjuration,
       because of the suspicion under which she rests, and there are various forms of abjuration for
       various degrees of suspicion, as will be shown in the fourth method of passing sentence; or,
       because of the evidence of the fact, and if she confesses her crime and is penitent, she shall
       not be handed over to the secular branch for capital punishment, but be sentenced by the
       ecclesiastical Judge to imprisonment for life. But notwithstanding the fact that she has been
       sentenced to imprisonment for life by the ecclesiastical Judge, the secular Judge can, on
       account of the temporal injuries which she has committed, deliver her to be burned. But all
       these matters will be made clear later when we deal with the sixth method of passing
       sentence.
             To sum up: Let the Judge first take care not to lend too easy belief to the Advocate
       when he pleads mortal enmity on behalf of the accused; for in these cases it is very seldom
       that anyone bears witness without enmity, because witches are always hated by everybody.
       Secondly, let him take note that there are four ways by which a witch can be convicted,
       namely, by witnesses, by direct evidence of the fact, and by her own confession. And if she
       is detained on account of a general report, she can be convicted by the evidence of
       witnesses; if on account of definite suspicion, the direct or indirect evidence of the facts can
       convict her, and by reason of these the suspicion may be judged to be either light or strong
       or grave. All this is when she does not confess; but when she does, the case can proceeds as
       has been said.
             Thirdly, let the Judge make use of all the foregoing circumstances to meet the plea of
       the Advocate, whether the accused is charged only by reason of a general report, or whether
       there are also certain evidences to support the charge by which she incurs slight or strong
       suspicion; and then he will be able to answer the Advocate’s allegation of personal enmity,
       which is the first line of defence which he may assume.
             But when the Advocate assumes the second line of defence, admitting that the accused
       has used such words against the deponent as, "You shall soon know what is going to happen
       to you," or "You will wish soon enough that you had lent or sold me what I asked for," or
       some such words; and submits that, although the deponent afterwards experienced some
       injury either to this person or his property, yet it does not follow from this that the accused
       was the cause of it as a witch, for illnesses may be due to various different causes. Also he
       submits that it is a common habit of women to quarrel together with such words, etc.
             The Judge ought to answer such allegations in the following manner. If the illness is
       due to natural causes, then the excuse is good. But the evidence indicates the contrary; for it
       cannot be cured by any natural remedy; or in the opinion of the physicians the illness is due
       to witchcraft, or is what is in common speech called a Night-scathe. Again, perhaps other
       enchantresses are of the opinion that it is due to witchcraft. Or because it came suddenly,
       without any previous sickening, whereas natural diseases generally develop gradually. Or
       perhaps because the plaintiff had found certain instruments of witchcraft under his bed or in
       his clothes or elsewhere, and when these were removed he was suddenly restored to health,
       as often happens, as we showed in the Second Part of this work where we treated of
       remedies. And by some such answer as this the Judge can easily meet this allegation, and
       show that the illness was due rather to witchcraft than to any natural causes, and that the
       accused must be suspected of causing such witchcraft, by reason of her threatening words.
       In the same way, if someone said, "I wish your barn would be burned down," and this
       should afterwards happen, it would engender a grave suspicion that the person who had used
       that threat had caused the barn to be set on fire, even if another person, and not he himself,
       had actually set light to it.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                      PART III, SECOND HEAD, QUESTION XII.
     Of the Same Matter, Declaring more Particularly how the Question of Personal Enmity is to be
                                   Investigated. The Seventh Action

             TAKE notice that only mortal enemies are debarred from giving evidence, as was
       shown in the Fifth Question. But the Judge may consider that to come to a decision about
       such enmity by the means we have just explained is rather dubious and unsatisfactory; and
       the accused or her Procurator may not be willing to accept a decision arrived at on such
       grounds as to whether the enmity is mortal or not. Therefore the Judge must use other means
       to decide concerning the alleged enmity, so that he may not punish the innocent, but exact
       full justice from the guilty. And though these means may savour of cunning and even guile,
       yet the Judge may employ them for the good of the faith and the State; for even S. Paul says:
       But being crafty, I caught you by guile. And these means are especially to be employed in
       the case of a prisoner who has not been publically defamed, and is not suspected because of
       the evidence of any fact; and the Judge may also employ them against prisoners who have
       alleged enmity on the part of the deponents, and wish to know all the names of the
       witnesses.
             The first method is this. The accused or her Advocate is given a copy of the process
       with the names of the deponents or informers, but not in the order in which they deposed;
       but in such a way that the name of the witness who comes first in the copy is sixth or
       seventh in the schedule, and he who comes second is last or last but one. In this way the
       accused will be deceived as to which witness deposed this or that. And then she will either
       say that they are all her enemies, or not; and if she says that they all are, she will be more
       easily detected in a lie when the cause of the enmity is investigated by the Judge; and if she
       names only certain ones, still the cause of the enmity will be more easily investigated.
             The second method is similar, when the Advocate is given a copy of the process, and
       separately a list of the names of the deponents; but there are added other matters perpetrated
       elsewhere by witches, but not set down in writing by the witnesses or deponents. And so the
       accused will not be able to say definitely that this one or that one is her mortal enemy,
       because she does not know what they have deposed against her.
             The third method was touched upon in the Fifth Question above. For when the accused
       is questioned at the end of her second examination, and before she has demanded to be
       defended or an Advocate has been allotted to her, let her be asked whether she thinks that
       she has any mortal enemies who, setting aside all fear of God, would falsely accuse her of
       the crime of heresy and witchcraft. And then perhaps without thinking, and not having seen
       the depositions of the witnesses, she will answer that she does not think that she has any
       such enemies. Or if she says, “I think I have,” and names any of the witnesses who have laid
       information, and the reason for that enmity is known, then the Judge will be able to
       investigate it with more certainty afterwards, when the accused has been given separate
       copies of the process and of the names of the witnesses, in the manner we have explained.
             The fourth method is this. At the end of her second examination and confession (as we
       showed in the Sixth Question), before she is granted any means of defence, let her be
       questioned as to the witnesses who have laid the more serious charges against her, in this
       manner. “Do you know So-and-so?• naming one of the witnesses; and then she will answer
       either Yes or No. If she says No, she will not be able, after she has been given means of
       defence and an Advocate, to plead that he is a mortal enemy, since she has said on oath that
       she does not know him. But if she says Yes, let her be asked whether she knows or has
       heard that he or she has acted in any way contrary to the Christian faith in the manner of a
       witch. Then if she says Yes, for he did such and such a thing; let her be asked whether he is
       her friend or enemy; and she will immediately answer that he is her friend, because of the
       testimony of such is not of very great account; and consequently she will not be able
       afterwards to plead an oath through her Advocate that he is her enemy, for she has already
       said that he is her friend. But if she answers that she knows nothing about him, let her again
       be asked whether he is her friend or enemy, and she will at once answer that he is her friend;
       for it would be futile to allege enmity on the part of someone of whom she knows nothing.
       Therefore she says, “I am his friend, but if I knew anything about him I would not fail to
       reveal it.” Therefore she will not be able afterwards to plead that her is her enemy. Or
       perhaps she will from the very beginning allege reasons for mortal enmity, and in that case
       some credence must be placed in the plea of the Advocate.
             A fifth method is to give the Advocate or the accused a copy of the process, with the
       names of the informers suppressed. And then the accused will guess, and very often rightly,
       who has deposed such and such against her. And then if she says, “So-and-so is my mortal
       enemy, and I am willing to prove it by witnesses,” then the Judge must consider whether the
       person named is the same person named in the schedule, and since she has said that she is
       willing to prove it by witnesses, he will examine those witnesses and inquire into the causes
       of the enmity, having secretly called into consultation learned and aged men of known
       prudence. And if he finds sufficient reasons for mortal enmity, he shall reject that evidence
       and dismiss the prisoner, unless there are other grave charges against her, sworn to by other
       witnesses.
             And this fifth method is commonly used; and it is found in practice that witches
       quickly guess from the copy of the process who has laid information against them. And
       because in such cases mortal enmity is rarely found unless it arises from the wicked deeds of
       the witch, therefore the Judge can easily come to a decision by the above means. Also it is to
       be noted that often the informers desire to confront the witch personally, and to charge her
       to her face with the bewitchment which has befallen them.
             There is still one more method whereunto the Judge may finally have recourse, when
       perhaps the other methods, and especially the first four, seem to some to savour too much of
       cunning and deceit. Accordingly, to satisfy and content the scrupulous, and that no fault may
       be found with the Judge, let him take care, after he has found by the above methods that
       there is no mortal enmity between the accused and the deponent, but wishes to remove all
       grounds for complaint by settling the question finally in consultation with his other
       assessors, to act as follows. Let him give to the accused or her Advocate a copy of the
       process, with the names of the deponents or informers suppressed. And since her defence is
       that she has mortal enemies, and perhaps she has alleged various reasons for the enmity,
       whether or not the facts are in agreement with her statements, let the Judge call into
       consultation learned men of every faculty (if such can be had), or at least some honest and
       reputable persons (for this is the purport of that statute we have so often quoted); and let him
       cause the whole process to be read through to them from end to end by the Notary or scribe,
       and let the names of the witnesses be made known to them, but under an oath of secrecy;
       and he shall first inquire whether or not they are willing to be bound by such an oath, for if
       not the names must by no means be declared to them.
             Then let him tell how he has inquired in such and such a manner into the alleged
       enmity, and has not been able to find any testimony of fact. But he shall add that, if they
       please, one of two courses shall be pursued. Either they shall decide then and there in
       consultation whether the evidence of any of the witnesses shall be rejected on the grounds of
       mortal personal enmity; or let them choose three or four or five persons who have most
       knowledge in that town or village of any friendship or enmity between the accused and the
       informer, who are not present at the consultation, and let them be informed of the names
       only of the accused and the witness, but not of the information which has been deposed, and
       let the whole question be left to their judgement. If they follow the former of these courses,
       they cannot very well reject any witness, since the Judge has already used his own methods
       of investigation; but by the second course he protects himself perfectly, and clears himself
       of all ugly suspicions. And he ought to observe this last method when the accused has been
       taken in a foreign town or country. These methods will suffice for examining the question of
       personal enmity.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                       PART III, SECOND HEAD, QUESTION XIII.
Of the Points to be Observed by the Judge before the Formal Examination in the Place of Detention and
                                   Torture. This is the Eighth Action

              THE next action of the Judge is quite clear. For common justice demands that a witch
       should not be condemned to death unless she is convicted by her own confession. But here
       we are considering the case of one who is judged to be taken in manifest heresy for one of
       the other two reasons set down in the First Question, namely, direct or indirect evidence of
       the fact, or the legitimate production of witnesses; and in this case she is to be exposed to
       questions and torture to extort a confession of her crimes.
              And to make the matter clear we will quote a case which occurred at Spires and came
       to the knowledge of many. A certain honest man was bargaining with a woman, and would
       not come to terms with her about the price of some article; so she angrily called after him,
       "You will soon wish you had agreed." For witches generally use this manner of speaking, or
       something like it, when they wish to bewitch a person by looking at him. Then he, not
       unreasonably being angry with her, looked over his shoulder to see with what intention she
       had uttered those words; and behold! he was suddenly bewitched so that his mouth was
       stretched sideways as far as his ears in a horrible deformity, and he could not draw it back,
       but remained so deformed for a long time.
              We put this case that this was submitted to the Judge as direct evidence of the fact; and
       it is asked whether the woman is to be considered as manifestly taken in the heresy of
       witchcraft. This should be answered from the words of S. Bernard which we have quoted
       above. For there are three ways in which a person may be judged to be so taken, and they
       not so closely conjoined as though it were necessary for all three to agree in one conclusion,
       but each one by itself, namely, the evidence of the fact, or the legitimate production of
       witnesses, or her own confession, is sufficient to prove a witch to be manifestly taken in that
       heresy.
              But indirect evidence of the fact is different from direct evidence; yet thought it is not
       so conclusive, it is still taken from the words and deeds of witches, as was shown in the
       Seventh Question, and it is judged from witchcraft which is not so immediate in its effect,
       but follows after some lapse of time from the utterance of the threatening words. Wherefore
       may we conclude that this is the case with such witches who have been accused and have
       not made good their defence (or have failed to defend themselves because this privilege was
       not granted them; and it was not granted because they did not ask for it). But what we are to
       consider now is what action the Judge should take, and how he should proceed to question
       the accused with a view to extorting the truth from her so that sentence of death may finally
       be passed upon her.
              And here, because of the great trouble caused by the stubborn silence of witches, there
       are several points which the Judge must notice, and these are dealt with under their several
       heads.
             And the first is that he must not be too quick to subject a witch to examination, but
       must pay attention to certain signs which will follow. And he must not be too quick for this
       reason: unless God, through a holy Angel, compels the devil to withhold his help from the
       witch, she will be so insensible to the pains of torture that she will sooner be torn limb from
       limb than confess any of the truth.
             But the torture is not to be neglected for this reason, for they are not all equally
       endowed with this power, and also the devil sometimes of his own will permits them to
       confess their crimes without being compelled by a holy Angel. And for the understanding of
       this the reader is referred to that which is written in the Second Part of this work concerning
       the homage which they offer to the devil.
             For there are some who obtain from the devil a respite of six or eight or ten years
       before they have to offer him their homage, that is, devote themselves to him body and soul;
       whereas others, when they first profess their abjuration of the faith, at the same time offer
       their homage. And the reason why the devil allows that stipulated interval of time is that,
       during that time, he may find out whether the witch has denied the faith with her lips only
       but not in her heart, and would therefore offer him her homage in the same way.
             For the devil cannot know the inner thoughts of the heart except conjecturally from
       outward indications, as we showed in the First Part of this work where we dealt with the
       question whether devils can turn the minds of men to hatred or love. And many have been
       found who, driven by some necessity or poverty, have been induced by other witches, in the
       hope of ultimate forgiveness in confession, to become either total or partial apostates from
       the faith. And it is such whom the devil deserts without any compulsion by a holy Angel;
       and therefore they readily confess their crimes, whereas others, who have from their hearts
       bound themselves to the devil, are protected by his power and preserve a stubborn silence.
             And this provides a clear answer to the question how it comes about that some witches
       readily confess, and others will by no means do so. For in the case of the former, when the
       devil is not compelled by God, he still deserts them of his own will, in order that by
       temporal unhappiness and a horrible death he may lead to despair those over whose hearts
       he could never obtain the mastery. For it is evident from their sacramental confessions that
       they have never voluntarily obeyed the devil, but have been compelled by him to work
       witchcraft.
             And some also are distinguished by the fact that, after they have admitted their crimes,
       they try to commit suicide by strangling or hanging themselves. And they are induced to do
       this by the Enemy, lest they should obtain pardon from God through sacramental confession.
       This chiefly happens in the case of those who have not been willing agents of the devil;
       although it may also happen in the case of willing agents, after they have confessed their
       crimes: but then it is because the devil has been compelled to desert the witch.
             In conclusion we may say that it is as difficult, or more difficult, to compel a witch to
       tell the truth as it is to exorcise a person possessed of the devil. Therefore the Judge ought
       not to be too willing or ready to proceed to such examination, unless, as has been said, the
       death penalty is involved. And in this case he must exercise great care, as we shall show;
       and first we shall speak of the method of sentencing a witch to such torture.

            “Hanging.” There are recorded many instances of this. In 1597 the Scotch warlock
        Playfair, having killed Lord Lothian by witchcraft, was laid for, and "being soon
        apprehended, was made prisoner in Dalkeith steeple, and having confest that and much
        more wickedness to Mr. Archibald Simson, minister there, and that confession coming to the
        ears of Robert, Earl of Lothian, my lord’s son, he had moyen to get some persons admited to
        speak with the prisoner in the night, by which means he was found worried in the morning,
        and the point of his breeches knit about his neck, but never more inquiry was made who had
        done the deed."
            Alice Gooderidge, a Derbyshire witch, who was tried in 1597 and condemned, "should
        have bin executed, but that her spirit killed her in the prison." John Stewart, a warlock of
        Irvine, in 1618, "for his better preferring to the day of the assys, was put in one lockfast
        buith, . . . and for avoyding of putting violent handis on himself, was verie strictly gairdit
        and flitherit be the airms, as us is." He was visited by two ministers, who exhorted him to
        repentance, and seemed very contrite, confessing his witchcrafts. However, almost
        immediately after "he was fund be the burrow officers, quha went about him stranglit and
        hangit be the cruik of the dur, with ane tait of hemp (or a string maid of hemp, supposed to
        haif been his garters, or string of his bonnet) not above the length of two span long, hi
        kneyis not being from the grund half ane span, and was brocht out of the hous, his lyf not
        being so layt expellit: but notwithstanding of quhat-somever meines usit to the contrair for
        remeid of his lyf, he revievit not, but so endit his lyf miserable by the help of the devill his
        maister." In 1649 the lady of Pittahro, Mistress Henderson, "being delated by many to be a
        witch, was apprehended and carried to Edenbroughe, wher she was keiped fast; and after
        her remaining in prison for a tyme, being in health all night, upon the morne was found
        dead. It was thought, and spoken by many, that she wronged her selfe, either by strangling
        or by poyson."
            It is recorded of the Renfrewshire trials (1697) that John Reid, a notorious warlock of
        Bargarran, "after his Confession had called out of his prison Window, desiring Baily Scott
        to keep that old body Angus Forrester, who had been his fellow prisoner, close and secure;
        whereupon the company asked John when they were leaving him on Friday night the 21st of
        May, whether he desired company or would be afraid alone, he said he had no fear of
        anything: So being left till Saturday in the Forenoon, he was found in this posture, viz.
        sitting upon a stool which was on the Hearth of the Chimney, with his feet on the floor and
        his Body straight upward, his shoulders touching the lintel of the Chimney, upon which the
        Company, especially John Campbell a Chyrurgeon who was called, thought at first in
        respect of his being in an ordinary posture of sitting, and the neck-cloath not having any
        drawn knot (or "run loup") but an ordinary one which was not very strait, and the sticke not
        having the strength to bear the weight of his Body or the struggle, that he had not been quite
        dead; but finding it otherways, and that he was such a Situation that he could not have been
        the Actor thereof himself, concluded that some extraordinary Agent had done it, especially
        considering that the Door of the room was secured, and that there was a board set over the
        Window which was not there the night before when they left him."

                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                      PART III, SECOND HEAD, QUESTION XIV.
 Of the Method of Sentencing the Accused to be Questioned: and How she must be Questioned on the
              First Day; and Whether she may be Promised her Life. The Ninth Action

             SECONDLY, the Judge must take care to frame his sentence in the following manner.
             We, the Judge and assessors, having attended to and considered the details of the
       process enacted by us against you N. of such a place in such a Diocese, and having
       diligently examined the whole matter, find that your are equivocal in your admissions; as for
       example, when you say that you used such threats with no intention of doing an injury, but
       nevertheless there are various proofs which are sufficient warrant for exposing you to the
       question and torture. Wherefore, that the truth may be known from your own mouth, and
       that henceforth you may not offend the ears of the Judges, we declare, judge and sentence
       that on this present day at such an hour you be placed under the question and torture. This
       sentence was given, etc.
             Alternatively, as has been said, the Judge may not be willing to deliver the accused up
       to be questioned, but may punish her with imprisonment with the following object in view.
       Let him summon her friends and put it to the that she may escape the death penalty,
       although she will be punished in another way, if she confesses the truth, and urge them to try
       to persuade her to do so. For very often meditation, and the misery of imprisonment, and the
       repeated advice of honest men, dispose the accused to discover the truth.
             And we have found that witches have been so strengthened by this sort of advice that,
       as a sign of their rebellion, they have spat on the ground as if it were in the devil's face,
       saying, “Depart, cursed devil; I shall do what is just” and afterwards they have confessed
       their crimes.
             But if, after keeping the accused in a state of suspense, and continually postponing the
       day of examination, and frequently using verbal persuasions, the Judge should truly believe
       that the accused is denying the truth, let them question her lightly without shedding blood;
       knowing that such questioning is fallacious and often, as has been said, ineffective.
             And it should be begun in this way. While the officers are preparing for the
       questioning, let the accused be stripped; or if she is a woman, let her first be led to the penal
       cells and there stripped by honest women of good reputation. And the reason for this is that
       they should search for any instrument of witchcraft sewn into her clothes; for they often
       make such instruments, at the instruction of devils, out of the limbs of unbaptized children,
       the purpose being that those children should be deprived of the beatific vision. And when
       such instruments have been disposed of, the Judge shall use his own persuasions and those
       of other honest men zealous for the faith to induce her to confess the truth voluntarily; and if
       she will not, let him order the officers to bind her with cords, and apply her to some engine
       of torture; and then let them obey at once but not joyfully, rather appearing to be disturbed
       by their duty. Then let her be released again at someone's earnest request, and taken on one
       side, and let her again be persuaded; and in persuading her, let her be told that she can
       escape the death penalty.
             Here it is asked whether, in the case of a prisoner legally convicted by her general bad
       reputation, by witnesses, and by the evidence of the fact, so that the only thing lacking is a
       confession of the crime from her own mouth, the Judge can lawfully promise her her life,
       whereas if she were to confess the crime she would suffer the extreme penalty.
             We answer that different people have various opinions on this question. For some hold
       that if the accused is of a notoriously bad reputation, and gravely suspected on unequivocal
       evidence of the crime; and if she is herself a great source of danger, as being the mistress of
       other witches, then she may be promised her life on the following conditions; that she be
       sentenced to imprisonment for life on bread and water, provided that she supply evidence
       which will lead to the conviction of other witches. And she is not to be told, when she is
       promised her life, that she is to be imprisoned in this way; but should be led to suppose that
       some other penance, such as exile, will be imposed on her as punishment. And without
       doubt notorious witches, especially such as use witches' medicines and cure the bewitched
       by superstitious means, should be kept in this way, both that they may help the bewitched,
       and that they may betray other witches. But such a betrayal by them must not be considered
       of itself sufficient ground for a conviction, since the devil is a liar, unless it is also
       substantiated by the evidence of the fact, and by witnesses.
             Others think that, after she has been consigned to prison in this way, the promise to
       spare her life should be kept for a time, but that after a certain period she should be burned.
             A third opinion is that the Judge may safely promise the accused her life, but in such a
       way that he should afterwards disclaim the duty of passing sentence on her, deputing
       another Judge in his place.
             There seems to be some advantage in pursuing the first of these courses on account of
       the benefit which may accrue from it to those who are bewitched; yet it is not lawful to use
       witchcraft to cure witchcraft, although (as was shown in the First and Introductory Question
       to this Third Part) the general opinion is that it is lawful to use vain and superstitious means
       to remove a spell. But use and experience and the variety of such cases will be of more
       value to Judges than any art or text-book; therefore this is a matter which should be left to
       the Judges. But it has certainly been very often found by experience that many would
       confess the truth if they were not held back by the fear of death.
             But if neither threats nor such promises will induce her to confess the truth, then the
       officers must proceed with the sentence, and she must by examined, not in any new or
       exquisite manner, but in the usual way, lightly or heavily according as the nature of her
       crimes demands. And while she is being questioned about each several point, let her be
       often and frequently exposed to torture, beginning with the more gentle of them; for the
       Judge should not be too hasty to proceed to the graver kind. And while this is being done, let
       the Notary write all down, how she is tortured and what questions are asked and how she
       answers.
             And note that, if she confesses under torture, she should then be taken to another place
       and questioned anew, so that she does not confess only under the stress of torture.
             The next step of the Judge should be that, if after being fittingly tortured she refuses to
       confess the truth, he should have other engines of torture brought before her, and tell her
       that she will have to endure these if she does not confess. If then she is not induced by terror
       to confess, the torture must be continued on the second or third day, but not repeated at that
       present time unless there should be some fresh indication of its probable success.
             Let the sentence be pronounced in her presence in the following manner: We the
       aforesaid Judge, as above, assign to you N. such a day for the continuation of your
       questioning, that the truth may be heard from your own mouth. And the Notary shall write
       all down in the process.
             And during the interval before that assigned time the Judge himself or other honest
       men shall do all in their power to persuade her to confess the truth in the manner we have
       said, giving her, if it seems expedient to them, a promise that her life will be spared.
             The Judge should also take care that during that interval there should always be guards
       with her, so that she is never left alone, for fear lest the devil will cause her to kill herself.
       But the devil himself knows better than anyone can set down in writing whether he will
       desert her of his own will, or be compelled to do so by God.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                       PART III, SECOND HEAD, QUESTION IV.
  Of the Continuing of the Torture, and of the Devices and Signs by which the Judge can Recognize a
 Witch; and how he ought to Protect himself from their Spells. Also how they are to be Shaved in Parts
where they use to Conceal the Devil's Masks and Tokens; together with the due Setting Forth of Various
  Means of Overcoming the Obstinacy in Keeping Silence and Refusal to Confess. And it is the Tenth
                                                Action.

             THE Judge should act as follows in the continuation of the torture. First he should bear
       in mind that, just as the same medicine is not applicable to all the members, but there are
       various and distinct salves for each several member, so not all heretics or those accused of
       heresy are to be subjected to the same method of questioning, examination and torture as to
       the charges laid against them; but various and different means are to be employed according
       to their various natures and persons. Now a surgeon cuts off rotten limbs; and mangy sheep
       are isolated from the healthy; but a prudent Judge will not consider it safe to bind himself
       down to one invariable rule in his method of dealing with a prisoner who is endowed with a
       witch's power of taciturnity, and whose silence he is unable to overcome. For if the sons of
       darkness were to become accustomed to one general rule they would provide means of
       evading it as a well-known snare set for their destruction.
             Therefore a prudent and zealous Judge should seize his opportunity and choose his
       method of conducting his examination according to the answers or depositions of the
       witnesses, or as his own previous experience or native wit indicates to him, using the
       following precautions.
             If he wishes to find out whether she is endowed with a witch's power of preserving
       silence, let him take note whether she is able to shed tears when standing in his presence, or
       when being tortured. For we are taught both by the words of worthy men of old and by our
       own experience that this is a most certain sign, and it has been found that even if she be
       urged and exhorted by solemn conjurations to shed tears, if she be a witch she will not be
       able to weep: although she will assume a tearful aspect and smear her cheeks and eyes with
       spittle to make it appear that she is weeping; wherefore she must be closely watched by the
       attendants.
             In passing sentence the Judge or priest may use some such method as the following in
       conjuring her to true tears if she be innocent, or in restraining false tears. Let him place his
       hand on the head of the accused and say: I conjure you by the bitter tears shed on the Cross
       by our Saviour the Lord JESUS Christ for the salvation of the world, and by the burning
       tears poured in the evening hour over His wounds by the most glorious Virgin MARY, His
       Mother, and by all the tears which have been shed here in this world by the Saints and Elect
       of God, from whose eyes He has now wiped away all tears, that if you be innocent you do
       now shed tears, but if you be guilty that you shall by no means do so. In the name of the
       Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.
             And it is found by experience that the more they are conjured the less are they able to
       weep, however hard they may try to do so, or smear their cheeks with spittle. Nevertheless it
       is possible that afterwards, in the absence of the Judge and not at the time or in the place of
       torture, they may be able to weep in the presence of their gaolers.
             And as for the reason for a witch's inability to weep, it can be said that the grace of
       tears is one of the chief gifts allowed to the penitent; for S. Bernard tells us that the tears of
       the humble can penetrate to heaven and conquer the unconquerable. Therefore there can be
       no doubt that they are displeasing to the devil, and that he uses all his endeavour to restrain
       them, to prevent a witch from finally attaining to penitence.
             But it may be objected that it might suit with the devil's cunning, with God's
       permission, to allow even a witch to weep; since tearful grieving, weaving and deceiving are
       said to be proper to women. We may answer that in this case, since the judgements of God
       are a mystery, if there is no other way of convicting the accused, by legitimate witnesses or
       the evidence of the fact, and if she is not under a strong or grave suspicion, she is to be
       discharged; but because she rests under a slight suspicion by reason of her reputation to
       which the witnesses have testified, she must be required to abjure the heresy of witchcraft,
       as we shall show when we deal with the second method of pronouncing sentence.
             A second precaution is to be observed, not only at this point but during the whole
       process, by the Judge and all his assessors; namely, that they must not allow themselves to
       be touched physically by the witch, especially in any contract of their bare arms or hands;
       but they must always carry about them some salt consecrated on Palm Sunday and some
       Blessed Herbs. For these can be enclosed together in Blessed Wax and worn round the neck,
       as we showed in the Second Part when we discussed the remedies against illnesses and
       diseases caused by witchcraft; and that these have a wonderful protective virtue is known
       not only from the testimony of witches, but from the use and practice of the Church, which
       exorcizes and blesses such objects for this very purpose, as is shown in the ceremony of
       exorcism when it is said, For the banishing of all the power of the devil, etc.
             But let it not be thought that physical contact of the joints or limbs is the only thing to
       be guarded against; for sometimes, with God's permission, they are able with the help of the
       devil to bewitch the Judge by the mere sound of the words which they utter, especially at the
       time when they are exposed to torture.
             And we know from experience that some witches, when detained in prison, have
       importunately begged their gaolers to grant them this one thing, that they should be allowed
       to look at the Judge before he looks at them; and by so getting the first sight of the Judge
       they have been able so to alter the minds of the Judge or his assessors that they have lost all
       their anger against them and have not presumed to molest them in any way, but have
       allowed them to go free. He who knows and has experienced it gives this true testimony;
       and would that they were not able to effect such things!
             Let judges not despise such precautions and protections, for by holding them in little
       account after such warning they run the risk of eternal damnation. For our Saviour said: If I
       had not come, and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse
       for their sin. Therefore let the judges protect themselves in the above manner, according to
       the provisions of the Church.
             And if it can conveniently be done, the witch should be led backward into the presence
       of the Judge and his assessors. And not only at the present point, but in all that has preceded

       or shall follow it, let him cross himself and approach her manfully, and with God's help the
       power of that old Serpent will be broken. And no one need think that it is superstitious to
       lead her in backwards; for, as we have often said, the Canonists allow even more than this to
       be done for the protections against witchcraft, and always say that it is lawful to oppose
       vanity with vanity.
             The third precaution to be observed in this tenth action is that the hair should be shaved
       from every part of her body. The reason for this is the same as that for stripping her of her
       clothes, which we have already mentioned; for in order to preserve their power of silence
       they are in the habit of hiding some superstitious object in their clothes or in their hair, or
       even in the most secret parts of the their bodies which must not be named.
             But it may be objected that the devil might, without the use of such charms, so harden
       the heart of a witch that she is unable to confess her crimes; just as it is often found in the
       case of other criminals, no matter how great the tortures to which they are exposed, or how
       much they are convicted by the evidence of the facts and of witnesses. We answer that it is
       true that the devil can affect such taciturnity without the use of such charms; but he prefers
       to use them for the perdition of souls and the greater offence to the Divine Majesty of God.
             This can be made clear from the example of a certain witch in the town of Hagenau,
       whom we have mentioned in the Second Part of this work. She used to obtain this gift of
       silence in the following manner: she killed a newly-born first-born male child who had not
       been baptized, and having roasted it in an oven together with other matters which it is not
       expedient to mention, ground it to powder and ashes; and if any witch or criminal carried
       about him some of this substance he would in no way be able to confess his crimes.
             Here it is clear that a hundred thousand children so employed could not of their own
       virtue endow a person with such a power of keeping silence; but any intelligent person can
       understand that such means are used by the devil for the perdition of souls and to offend the
       Divine Majesty.
             Again, it may be objected that very often criminals who are not witches exhibit the
       same power of keeping silence. In answer to this it must be said tat this power of taciturnity
       can proceed from three causes. First, from a natural hardness of heart; for some are
       soft-hearted, or even feeble-minded, so that at the slightest torture they admit everything,
       even some things which are not true; whereas others are so hard that however much they are
       tortured the truth is not to be had from them; and this is especially the case with those who
       have been tortured before, even if their arms are suddenly stretched or twisted.
             Secondly, it may proceed from some instrument of witchcraft carried about the person,
       as has been said, either in the clothes or in the hairs of the body. And thirdly, even if the
       prisoner has no such object secreted about her person, they are sometimes endowed with this
       power by other witches, however far they may be removed from them. For a certain witch at
       Issbrug used to boast that, if she had no more than a thread from the garments of any
       prisoner, she could so work that however much that prisoner were tortured, even to death,
       she would be unable to confess anything. So the answer to this objection is clear.
             But what is to be said of a case that happened in the Diocese of Ratisbon? Certain
       heretics were convicted by their own confession not only as impenitent but as open
       advocates of that perfidy; and when they were condemned to death it happened that they
       remained unharmed in the fire. At length their sentence was altered to death by drowning,
       but this was no more effective. All were astonished, and some even began to say that their

       heresy must be true; and the Bishop, in great anxiety for his flock, ordered a three days' fast.
       When this had been devoutly fulfilled, it came to the knowledge of someone that those
       heretics had a magic charm sewed between the skin and the flesh under one arm; and when
       this was found and removed, they were delivered to the flames and immediately burned.
       Some say that a certain necromancer learned this secret during a consultation with the devil,
       and betrayed it; but however it became known, it is probably that the devil, who is always
       scheming for the subversion of faith, was in some way compelled by Divine power to reveal
       the matter.
             From this it may be seen what a Judge ought to do when such a case happens to him:
       namely, that he should rely upon the protection of God, and by the prayers and fasting of
       devout persons drive away this sort of devil's work from witches, in those cases where they
       cannot be made to confess under torture even after their clothes have been changed and all
       their hair has been shaved off and abraded.
             Now in the parts of Germany such shaving, especially of the secret parts, is not
       generally considered delicate, and therefore we Inquisitors do not use it; but we cause the
       hair of their head to be cut off, and placing a morsel of Blessed Wax in a cup of Holy Water
       and invoking the most Holy Trinity, we give it them to drink three times on a fasting
       stomach, and by the grace of God we have by this means caused many to break their silence.
       But in other countries the Inquisitors order the witch to be shaved all over her body. And the
       Inquisitor of Como has informed us that last year, that is, in 1485, he ordered forty-one
       witches to be burned, after they had been shaved all over. And this was in the district and
       county of Burbia, commonly called Wormserbad, in the territory of the Archduke of
       Austria, towards Milan.
             But it may be asked whether, in a time of need, when all other means of breaking a
       witch's silence have failed, it would be lawful to ask the advice in this matter of sorceresses
       who are able to cure those who are bewitched. We answer that, whatever may have been doe
       in that matter at Ratisbon, it is our earnest admonition in the Lord that no one, no matter
       how great may be the need, should consult with sorceresses on behalf of the State; and this
       because of the great offence which is thereby caused to the Divine Majesty, when there are
       so many other means open to us which we may use either in their own proper form or in
       some equivalent form, so that the truth will be had from their own mouths and they can be
       consigned to the flames; or failing this, God will in the meantime provide some other death
       for the witch.
             For there remain to us the following remedies against this power of silence. First, let a
       man do all that lies in his own power by the exercise of his qualities, persisting often with
       the methods we have already mentioned, and especially on certain days, as will be shown in
       the following Question. See II. Corinthians ix: That ye may abound in all good works.
             Secondly, if this should fail, let him consult with other persons; for perhaps they may
       think of some means which has not occurred to him, since there are various methods of
       counteracting witchcraft.
             Thirdly, if these two fail, let him have recourse to devout persons, as it is said in
       Ecclesiasticus xxxvii: Be continually with a godly man, whom thou knowest to keep the
       commandments of the Lord. Also let him invoke the Patron Saints of the country. But if all
       these fail, let the Judge and all the people at once put their trust in God with prayers and
       fasting, that the witchcraft may be removed by reason of their piety. For so Josaphat prayed
       in II. Paralipomenon xx: When we know no what we should do, we have this one refuge,
       that we should turn our eyes to Thee. And without doubt God will not fail us in our need.
             To this effect also S. Augustine speaks (26, q. 7, non obseruabitis): Whosoever
       observes any divinations or auguries, or attends to or consents to such as observe them, or
       gives credit to such by following after their works, or goes into their houses, or introduces
       them into his own house, or asks questions of them, let him know that he has perverted the
       Christian faith and his baptism and is a pagan and apostate and enemy of God, unless he is
       corrected by ecclesiastical penances and is reconciled with God. Therefore let the Judge not
       fail always to use the lawful remedies, as we have said, together with these following final
       precautions.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

           “Tears.” The beautiful devotion to the Sacred Tears of Our Lord is well known. The
        Premonstratensians have a Mass, “De Lacryma Christi,” proper to the Order.
           Our Lady of Tears, Santa Maria delle Lagrime, is the Patroness of Spoleto. A picture of
        Our Lady, painted upon the wall of the house belonging to Diotallevio d’Antonio, which
        stood on the road from Spoleto to Trevi, was seen to shed tears in great abundance. Many
        graces and favours were obtained before the miraculous picture. A small chapel was
        erected on the spot in August 1485, and Mass was daily offered therein. On 27 March 1487,
        the large basilica was begun, which on its completion, 8 March 1489, was entrusted to the
        Olivetans.



           “Blessed Wax.” The “Agnus Dei,” which is a disc of wax, stamped with the figure of a
        Lamb, and on certain stated days blessed by the Holy Father. These Agnus Deis may either
        be worn suspended round the neck, or preserved as objects of devotion. They are to be
        regarded as Sacramentals.



           “Sin.” S. John" xv, 22.



            “Gift of Silence.” De Lancre, “Tableau de l’inconstance des mauvais agnes et demons,”
        Paris, 1912, has: “pour ne confessor iamais le secret de l’escole, on faict au sabbat une
        paste de millet noir, auec de la poudre du foyer de quelque enfant non baptise qu’on faict
        secher, puis meslant cette poudre avec ladicte paste, elle a cette vertu de tacitrunite; si bien
        que qui en mange ne confesse iamais.” Five Forfar witches, of which one was Helen
        Guthrie, in 1661 dug up the body of an unbaptized infant, which was buried in the
        churchyard near the south-east door of the church “and took severall peices thereof, as the
        feet, hands, pairt of the head, and a pairt of the buttocks, and they made a py thereof, that
        they might eat of it, that by this means they might never make a confession (as they thought)
        of their witchcraft.”




                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                      PART III, SECOND HEAD, QUESTION XVI.
Of the fit Time and of the Method of the Second Examination. And it is the Eleventh Action, concerning
                           the Final Precautions to be Observed by the Judge

             THERE are one or two points to be noted with regard to what we have just written.
       First, that witches should be questioned on the more Holy Days and during the
       solemnization of the Mass, and that the people should be exhorted to pray for Divine help,
       not in any specific manner, but that they should invoke the prayers of the Saints against all
       the plagues of the devil.
             Secondly, as we have said before, the Judge should wear round his neck Consecrated
       Salt and other matters, with the Seven Words which Christ uttered on the Cross written in a
       schedule, and all bound together. And he should, if he conveniently can, wear these made
       into the length of Christ's stature against his naked body, and bind other Holy things about
       him. For it is shown by experience that witches are greatly troubled by these things, and can
       hardly refrain from confessing the truth. The Relics of the Saints, too, are of especial virtue.
             Having taken these precautions, and after giving her Holy Water to drink, let him again
       begin to question her, all the time exhorting her as before. And while she is raised from the
       ground, if she is being tortured in this way, let the Judge read or cause to be read to her the
       depositions of the witnesses with their names, saying: “See! You are convicted by the
       witnesses.” Also, if the witnesses are willing to confront her face to face, the Judge shall ask
       her if she will confess if the witnesses are brought before her. And if she consents, let the
       witnesses be brought in and stand before her, so that she may be contrained or shamed into
       confessing some of her crimes.
             Finally, if he sees that she will not admit her crimes, he shall ask her whether, to prove
       her innocence, she is ready to undergo the ordeal by red-hot iron. And they all desire this,
       knowing that the devil will prevent them from being hurt; therefore a true witch is exposed
       in this manner. The Judge shall ask her how she can be so rash as to run so great a risk, and
       all shall be written down; but it will be shown later that they are never to be allowed to
       undergo this ordeal by red-hot iron.
             Let the Judge also not that when witches are questioned on a Friday, while the people
       are gathered together at Holy Mass to await our Saviour, they very often confess.
             But we must proceed to the extreme case, when after every expedient has been tried the
       witch still maintains silence. The Judge shall then loose her and, using the precautions
       which follow, shall take her from the place of punishment to another place under a strong
       guard; but let him take particular care not to release her on any sort of security; for when
       that is done, they never confess the truth, but always become worse.
             But in the first place let him cause her to be well treated in the manner of food and
       drink, and meanwhile let honest persons who are under no suspicion enter to her and talk
       often with her on indifferent subjects, and finally advise her in confidence to confess the
       truth, promising that the Judge will be merciful to her and that they will intercede for her.
       And finally let the Judge come in and promise that he will be merciful with the mental
       reservation that he means he will be merciful to himself or the State; for whatever is done
       for the safety of the State is merciful.
             But if he promises her her life, as we showed in Question XIV that he can do in three
       ways, let it all be written down by the Notary in what words and with what intention mercy
       was promised. And if the accused begs for mercy in this way, and discovers her crime, let
       her be promised in a vague and general way that she will receive even more than she has
       petitioned for, so that she may speak with the greater confidence.
             As a second precaution in this case, when she refuses altogether to reveal the truth, the
       Judge should, as we have said before, examine her friends and associates without her
       knowledge; and if these have deposed anything which might lead to her conviction, this
       must be diligently investigated. Also, if any instruments or unguents or boxes have been
       found in her house, they should be shown to her, and she should be asked for what purposes
       they have been used.
             A third precaution can be taken when she still persists in her obstinancy after her
       associates have been examined and borne witness against her, and not for her. If she has no
       friends, let some other trustworthy man who is known to be congenial to the accused and to
       some extent a patron of hers, enter to the witch one evening and engage her in a protracted
       conversation. And then, if he is not an accomplice, let him pretend that it is too late for him
       to return, and stay in the prison with her, and continue talking during the night. And if he is
       an accomplice, let them eat and drink together, and talk to each other about the things they
       have done. And then let it be arranged that spies should stand outside in a convenient place,
       and listen to them and take note of their words, and if necessary let the have a scribe with
       them.
             As a fourth precaution, if she then begins to tell the truth, let the Judge on no account
       postpone hearing her confession, even in the middle of the night, buy proceed with it to the
       best of his ability. And if it is in the day-time, let him not care if he delays his luncheon or
       dinner, but persist until she has told the truth, at least in the main. For it is generally found
       that, after postponements and interruptions, they return to their vomit and will not reveal the
       truth which they began to confess, having thought worse of it.
             And let the Judge take note that, after she has confessed the injuries done to men and
       animals, he shall ask her for how many years she has had an Incubus devil, and how long it
       is since she abjured the faith. For they never confess to these matters unless they have first
       confessed to these matters unless they have first confessed their other deeds; therefore they
       must be asked concerning these last of all.
             As a fifth precaution, when all the above have failed, let her, if possible, be led to some
       castle; and after she has been kept there under custody for some days, let the castellan
       pretend that he is going on a long journey. And then let some of his household, or even
       some honest women, visit her and promise that they will set her entirely at liberty if she will
       teach them how to conduct certain practices. And let the Judge take note that by this means
       they have very often confessed and been convicted.
             Quite lately a witch was detained in the Castle of Königsheim near the town of
       Schlettstadt in the Diocese of Strasburg, and could not be induced by any tortures or
       questions to confess her crimes. But at last the castellan used the method we have just

       described. Although he was himself present in the castle, the witch thought he was away,
       and three of his household came in to her and promised they would set her free if she would
       teach them how to do certain things. At first she refused, saying that they were trying to
       entrap her; but at last she asked what it was that they wanted to know. And one asked how
       to raise a hailstorm, and another asked about carnal matters. When at length she agreed to
       show him how to raise a hailstorm, and a bowl of water had been brought in, the witch told
       him to stir the water with his finger, and herself uttered certain words, and suddenly the
       place which he had named, a wood near the castle, was visited by such a tempest and storm
       of hail as had not been seen for many years.
             It yet remains to show how the Judge is to proceed in pronouncing sentence in a case
       where all these means have failed, or what is further to be done even when she has
       confessed her crimes, that the whole process may be brought to an end; and we shall
       complete this Last Part of this work with a consideration of these matters.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

           “They Return.” “Proverbs” xxvi, II: “As a dog that returneth to his vomit, so is the fool

        the mire.”

                 Which is the Last Part of the Work: How the Process is to be Concluded by the
                                Pronouncement of a Definite and Just Sentence.

             HAVING by the grace of God examined the proper means of arriving at a knowledge
       of the heresy of witchcraft, and having shown how the process on behalf of the faith should
       be initiated and proceeded with, it remains to discuss how that process is to be brought to a
       fitting termination with an appropriate sentence.
             Here it is to be noted that this heresy, as was shown in the beginning of this Last Part,
       is not to be confused with other simple heresies, since it is obvious that it is not a pure and
       single crime, but partly ecclesiastical and partly civil. Therefore in dealing with the methods
       of passing sentence, we must first consider a certain kind of sentence to which witches are in
       the habit of appealing, in which the secular judge can act on his own account independently
       of the Ordinary. Secondly, we shall consider those in which he cannot act without the
       Ordinary. And so thirdly it will be shown how the Ordinaries can discharge themselves of
       their duties.

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                       PART III, THIRD HEAD, QUESTION XVII.
       Of Common Purgation, and especially of the Trial of Red-hot Iron, to which Witches Appeal

             THE question is now asked whether the secular judge may allow a witch to be
       submitted to a common purgation (concerning which see the Canon 2, q. 4, consuluisti, and
       cap. monomachiam), in the manner in which a civil defendant is allowed the trial by ordeal,
       as, for example, that by red-hot iron. And it may seem that he may do so.
             For trial by combat is allowable in a criminal case for the protection of life, and in a
       civil case for the protection of property; then wherefore not the trial by red-hot iron or
       boiling water? S. Thomas allows that the former is permissible in some cases, when he says
       in the last article of the Second of the Second, q. 95, that a duel is lawful when it appears to
       be consonant with commonsense. Therefore the trial by red-hot iron should also be lawful in
       some cases.
             Also it has been used by many Princes of saintly life who have availed themselves of
       the advice and counsel of good men; as, for example, the Sainted Emperor Henry in the case
       of the virgin Cunegond whom he had married, who was suspected of adultery.
             Again, a judge, who is responsible for the safety of the community, may lawfully allow
       a smaller evil that a greater may be avoided; as he allows the existence of harlots in towns in
       order to avoid a general confusion of lust. For S. Augustine On Free Will says: Take away
       the harlots, and you will create a general chaos and confusion of lust. So, when a person has
       been loaded with insults and injuries by any community, he can clear himself of any
       criminal or civil charge by means of a trial by ordeal.
             Also, since less hurt is caused to the hands by the red-hot iron than is the loss of life in
       a duel, if a duel is permitted where such things are customary, much more should the trial by
       red-hot iron be allowed.
             But the contrary view is argued where it says (2, q. 5, monomachiam) that they who
       practice such and similar things appear to be tempting God. And here the Doctors affirm it
       must be noted that, according to S. Paul (I. Thessalonians v), we must abstain, not only from
       evil, but from all appearance of evil. Therefore the Canon says in that chapter, not that they
       who use such practices tempt God, but that they appear to tempt Him, so that it may be
       understood that, even if a man engage in such a trial with none but good intentions, yet since
       it has the appearance of evil, it is to be avoided.
             I answer that such tests or trials are unlawful for two reasons. First, because their
       purpose is to judge of hidden matters of which it belongs only to God to judge. Secondly,
       because there is no Divine authority for such trials, nor are they anywhere sanctioned in the
       writings of the Holy Fathers. And it says in the chapter consuluisti, 2, q. 5: That which is not
       sanctioned in the writings of the Sainted Fathers is to be presumed superstitious. And Pope
       Stephen in the same chapter says: It is left to your judgement to try prisoners who are

       convicted by their own confession or the proofs of the evidence; but leave that which is
       hidden and unknown to Him Who alone knows the hearts of men.
             There is, nevertheless, a difference between a duel and the trial by red-hot iron or
       boiling water. For a duel appears to be more humanly reasonable, the combatants being of
       similar strength and skill, than a trial by red-hot iron. For although the purpose of both is to
       search out something hidden by means of a human act; yet in the case of trial by red-hot iron
       a miraculous effect is looked for, whereas this is not so in the case of a duel, in which all
       that can happen is the death of either, or both, of the combatants. Therefore the trial by
       red-hot iron is altogether unlawful; though a duel is not illegal to the same extent. So much
       has been incidentally admitted in respect of duels, on account of Princes and secular Judges.
             It is to be noted that, because of those words of S. Thomas which make the above
       distinction, Nicolas of Lyra, in his Commentary on the duel or combat between David and
       Goliath, I. Regum xvii, tried to prove that in some cases a duel is lawful. But Paul of Burgos
       proves that not this, but rather the opposite was the meaning of S. Thomas; and all Princes
       and secular Judges ought to pay particular attention to his proof.
             His first point is that a duel, like the other trial by ordeal, has as its purpose the
       judgement of something hidden, which ought to be left to the judgement of God, as we have
       said. And it cannot be said that this combat of David is an authority for duelling; for it was
       revealed to him by the Lord through some inner instinct that he must engage in that combat
       and avenge upon the Philistine the injuries done against God, as is proved by David's words:
       I come against thee in the name of the living God. So he was not properly speaking a
       duellist, but he was an executor of Divine justice.
             His second point is that Judges must especially note that in a duel power, or at least
       licence, is given to each of the parties to kill the other. But since one of them is innocent,
       that power of licence is given for the killing of an innocent man; and this is unlawful, as
       being contrary to the dictates of natural law and to the teaching of God. Therefore, a duel is
       altogether unlawful, not only on the part of the appellant and the respondent, but also on the
       part of the Judge and his advisers, who are all equally to be considered homicides or parties
       to manslaughter.
             Thirdly, he points out that a duel is a single combat between two men, the purpose of
       which is that the justice of the case should be made clear by the victory of one party, as if by
       Divine judgement, notwithstanding the fact that one of the parties is fighting in an unjust
       cause; and in this way God is tempted. Therefore it is unlawful on the part both of the
       appellant and the respondent. But considering the fact that the judges have other means of
       arriving at an equitable and just termination of the dispute, when they do not use such
       means, but advise or even permit a duel when they could forbid it, they are consenting to the
       death of an innocent person.
             But since it is unlikely that Nicolas the Commentator was unaware or ignorant of the
       above reasoning, it is concluded that, when he says that in some cases a duel can be fought
       without mortal sin, he is speaking on the part of the Judges or advisers, namely, in a case
       when such a trial is undertaken, not on their responsibility or advice, but purely on that of
       the appellant and respondent themselves.
             But since it is not our purpose to linger over and debate such considerations, but to
       return to the question of witches, it is clear that, if this sort of trial is forbidden in the case of
       other criminal causes, such as theft or robbery, still more must it be forbidden in the case of
       witches who, it is agreed, obtain all their power from the devil, whether it be for causing or
       curing an injury, for removing or for preventing an effect of witchcraft.
             And it is not wonderful witches are able to undergo this trial by ordeal unscathed with
       the help of devils; for we learn from naturalists that if the hands be anointed with the juice
       of a certain herb they are protected from burning. Now the devil has an exact knowledge of
       the virtues of such herbs: therefore, although he can cause the hand of the accused to be
       protected from the red-hot iron by invisibly interposing some other substance, yet he can
       procure the same effect by the use of natural objects. Hence even less that other criminals
       ought witches to be allowed this trial by ordeal, because their intimate familiarity with the
       devil; and from the very fact of their appealing to this trial they are to be held as suspected
       witches.
             An incident illustrative of our argument occurred hardly three years ago in the Diocese
       of Constance. For in the territory of the Counts of Fuerstenberg and the Black Forest there
       was a notorious witch who had been the subject of much public complaint. At last, as the
       result of a general demand, she was seized by the Count and accused of various evil works
       of witchcraft. When she was being tortured and questioned, wishing to escape from their
       hands, she appealed to the trial by red-hot iron; and the Count, being you and inexperienced,
       allowed it. And she then carried the red-hot iron not only for the stipulated three paces, but
       for six, and offered to carry it even farther. Then, although they ought to have taken this as
       manifest proof that she was a witch (since one of the Saints dared to tempt the help of God
       in this manner), she was released from her chains and lives to the present time, not without
       grave scandal to the Faith in those parts.

           “Henry.” S. Henry II, German Kind and Roman Emperor, was born 972, and died in his
        palace of Grona, at Goettingen, 13 July, 1024. He was canonized in 1146 by Eugenius III;
        and his wife Cunegond on 3 March 1200, by Innocent III. Later writers are inclined to
        believe that the ascetic theme of his maiden marriage has no foundation in fact. Saint Henry
        on assuming the Imperial dignity took to wife Cunegond, daughter of Siegfried, Count of
        Luxemburg. It has been beautifully said that she shares her husband’s celestial, as she
        shared his earthly crown. When scandalous reports were circulated concerning her honour,
        although her husband could not for a moment suspect her purity, she insisted upon an
        appeal to the trial by ordeal, and having walked unhurt over the red-hot plough-shares,
        publicly testified her innocence. The story is immensely popular in German poetry and
        German art. A print by Hans Burgkmair shows her stepping over the shares, one of which
        she holds in her hand. Upon her shrine in the Cathedral at Bamburg a bas-relief by Hans
        Thielmann of Warzburg depicts the same incident. Having already retired to a Benedictine
        cloister, upon the death of her husband S. Cunegond took the veil.



           “On Free Will.” S. Augustine’s “De Gratia et libero Arbitrio” was written 426—27. It
        will be found in Migne, "Patres Latini," xliv. pp. 881—912.

        even during the few short months of his Pontificate he showed himself a zealous reformer.




                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                       PART III, THIRD HEAD, QUESTION XIII.
                      Of the Manner of Pronouncing a Sentence which is Final and Definitive

             IN proceeding to treat of those cases in which the secular Judge by himself can arrive
       at a judgement and pronounce a sentence without the co-operation of the Diocesan and
       Ordinaries, we necessarily presuppose that not only is it consistent with the protection of the
       faith and of justice that we Inquisitors should be relieved of the duty of passing sentence in
       these cases, but in the same sincerity of spirit we endeavour to relieve the Diocesans also
       from that duty; not in any desire to detract from their authority and jurisdiction, for if they
       should elect to exercise their authority in such matters, it would follow that we Inquisitors
       must also concur in it.
             It must be remembered, also, that this crime of witches is not purely ecclesiastic;
       therefore the temporal potentates and Lords are not debarred from trying and judging it. At
       the same time was shall show that in some cases they must not arrive at a definitive
       judgement without the authorisation of the Diocesans.
             But first we must consider the sentence itself: secondly, the nature of its
       pronouncement; and thirdly, in how many ways it is to be pronounced.
             With regard to the first of these questions, S. Augustine says that we must not
       pronounce sentence against any person unless he has been proved guilty, or has confessed.
       Now there are three kinds of sentence - interlocutory, definitive, and preceptive. These are
       explained as follows by S. Raymond. An interlocutory sentence is one which is given not on
       the main issue of the case, but on some other side issues which emerge during the hearing of
       a case; such as a decision whether or not a witness is to be disallowed, or whether some
       digression is to be admitted, and such matters as that. Or it may perhaps be called
       interlocutory because it is delivered simply by word of mouth without the formality of
       putting it into writing.
             A definitive sentence is one which pronounces a final decision as to the main issue of
       the case.
             A preceptive sentence is one which is pronounced by a lower authority on the
       instruction of a higher. But we shall be concerned with the first two of these, and especially
       with the definitive sentence.
             Now it is laid down by law that a definitive sentence which has been arrived at without
       a due observance of the proper legal procedure in trying a case is null and void in law; and
       the legal conduct of a case consists in two things. One concerns the basis of the judgement;
       for there must be a due provision for the hearing of arguments both for the prosecution and
       the defence, and a sentence arrived at without such a hearing cannot stand. The other is not
       concerned with the basis of the judgement, but provides that the sentence must not be
       conditional; for example, a claim for possession should not be decided conditionally upon
       some subsequent claim of property; but where there is no question of such an objection the
       sentence shall stand.
            But in the case we are considering, which is a process on behalf of the faith against a
       charge of heresy (though the charge is a mixed one), the procedure is straighforward and
       summary. That is to say, the Judge need not require a writ, or demand that the case should
       be contested. But he must allow opportunity for the necessary proofs, and issue his citation,
       and exact the protestation of the oath concerning calumny, etc. Therefore there has lately
       been a new law made as to the method of procedure in such cases.
            To proceed to our second consideration, namely, of the nature of the pronouncement of
       the sentence, it must be noted that it should be pronounced by the Judge and no one else,
       otherwise it is not valid. Also the Judge must be sitting in a public and honourable place;
       and he must pronounce it in the day-time and not in the darkness; and there are other
       conditions to be observed; for example, the sentence must not be promulgated upon a Holy
       Day, nor yet merely delivered in writing.
            Yet it is to be noted that since, as we have said, this case is conducted in a simple and
       summary manner, it may lawfully be conducted on Holy Days for the sake of the
       convenience of the public, and the Judge may cut short any digressions. Therefore the Judge
       may, if he pleases, act in such a manner, and even pass sentence without putting it in
       writing. For we are authoritatively informed that there are cases in which a sentence is valid
       without its being put into writing, as, for example, when such is the custom of any particular
       locality or Court. Also there is excellent precedent for a Bishop, when he is the Judge,
       allowing the sentence to be pronounced by some other person.
            Note again that, although in criminal actions the execution of the sentence is not to be
       delayed, this rule does not hold good in four cases, with two of which we are here
       concerned. First, when the prisoner is a pregnant woman; and then the sentence shall be
       delayed until she has given birth. Secondly, when the prisoner has confessed her crime, but
       has afterwards denied it again: that is to say, when the way which we explained in the
       Fourteenth Question.
            Now before we proceed to our third consideration, namely, the different methods of
       passing sentence which we shall proceed to treat of up to the end of this work, we must first
       make some remarks about the various ways in which a prisoner is rendered suspect, from
       which the various methods of passing sentence follow as a consequence.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                       PART III, THIRD HEAD, QUESTION XIX.
       Of the Various Degrees of Overt Suspicion which render the Accused liable to be Sentenced

             BOTH the old and the new legislature provide an answer to the question as to in how
       many and what ways a person can be held suspect of heresy or any other crime, and whether
       they can be judged and sentenced by reason of such suspicions. For the gloss on the chapter
       nos in quemquam, which we quoted in the last Question, says that there are four means of
       convicting a prisoner: either by the depositions of witnesses in Court, or by the evidence of
       the facts, or by reason of previous convictions against the prisoner, or because of a grave
       suspicion.
             And the Canonists note that suspicion is of three kinds. The first of which the Canon
       says, “You shall not judge anyone because he is suspect in your own opinion.” The second
       is Probably; and this, but not the first, leads to a purgation. The third is Grave, and leads to a
       conviction; and S. Jerome understands this kind of suspicion when he says that a wife may
       be divorced either for fornication or for a reasonably suspected fornication.
             It must further be noted that the second, or highly probable and circumstantial,
       suspicion is admitted as a kind of half-proof; that is to say, it helps to substantiate other
       proofs. Therefore it can also lead to a judgement, and not only to a purgation. And as for the
       grave suspicion, which suffices for a conviction, note that it is of two kinds. One is of the
       law and by the law, as when the law fixes and determines some point against which no proof
       can be admitted. For example, if a man has given a woman a promise of matrimony, and
       copulation has ensued, then matrimony is presumed, and no proof to the contrary is
       admitted. The second is of the law but not by the law, as where the law presumes but does
       not determine a fact. For example, if a man has lived for a long time with a woman, she is
       presumed to have had connexion with him; but against this proofs are admitted.
             Applying this to our discussion of the heresy of witches and to the modern laws, we say
       that in law there are three degrees of suspicion in the matter of heresy: the first slight, the
       second great, and the third very great.
             The first is in law called a light suspicion. Of this it is said in the chapter Accusatus, de
       Haeret. Lib. 6: If the accused has incurred only a light and small suspicion, and if she
       should again fall under that suspicion, although she is to be severely punished for this, she
       ought not to suffer the punishment of those who have relapsed into heresy. And this
       suspicion is called small or light, both because it can be removed by a small and light
       defence, and because it arises from small and light conjectures. Therefore it is called small,
       because of the small proofs of it; and light, because of the light conjectures.
             As an example of simple heresy, if people are found to be meeting together secretly for
       the purpose of worship, or differing in their manner of life and behaviour from the usual
       habits of the faithful; or if they meet together in sheds and barns, or at the more Holy
       Seasons in the remoter fields or woods, by day or by night, or are in any way found to
       separate themselves and not to attend Mass at the usual times or in the usual manner, or
       form secret friendships with suspected witches: such people incur at least a light suspicion
       of heresy, because it is proved that heretics often act in this manner. And of this light
       suspicion the Canon says: They who are by a slight argument discovered to have deviated
       from the teaching and path of the Catholic religion are not to be classed as heretics, nor is a
       sentence to be pronounced against them.
             Henry of Segusio agrees with this in his Summa; de Praesumptione, where he says: It
       is to be noted that although a heretic be convicted by a slight argument of that matter of
       which he is suspected, he is not on that account to be considered a heretic; and he proves it
       by the above reasoning.
             The second or grave suspicion is in law called grave or vehement, and of this the above
       Canon (Accusatus) again says: One who is accused or suspected of heresy, against whom a
       grave or vehement suspicion of this crime has arisen, etc. And it goes on: And these are not
       two kinds but the same kind of suspicion. Giovanni d’Andrea also says: Vehement is the
       same as strong, as the Archdeacon says speaking of this Canon. Also Bernardus Papiensis
       and Huguccio say that vehement is the same as strong or great. S. Gregory also, in the First
       Book of his Morals says: A vehement wind sprang up. Therefore we say that anyone has a
       vehement case when he has a strong one. So much for this.
             Therefore a great suspicion is called vehement or strong; and it is so called because it is
       dispelled only by a vehement and strong defence, and because it arises from great,
       vehement, and strong conjectures, arguments, and evidence. As, to take an example of
       simple heresy, when people are found to shelter known heretics, and show favour to them,
       or visit and associate with them and give gifts to them, receive them into their houses and
       protect them, and such like: such people are vehemently suspected of heresy. And similarly
       in the heresy of witches, they are brought under suspicion when they share in the crimes of
       witches.
             And here are especially to be noted those men or women who cherish some inordinate
       love or excessive hatred, even if they do not use to work any harm against men or animals in
       other ways. For, as we have said, those who behave in this way in any heresy are strongly to
       be suspected. And this is shown by the Canon where it says that there is no doubt that such
       persons act in this way out of some heretical sympathy.
             The third and greatest suspicion is in law called grave or violent: for the Canon and the
       glosses of the Archdeacon and Giovanni d’Andrea explain that the word vehement does not
       mean the same as the word violent. And of this suspicion the Canon says (dist. 34): This
       presumption or suspicion is called violent because it violently constrains and compels a
       Judge to believe it, and cannot be cast off by any evasion; and also because it arises from
       violent and convincing conjectures.
             For example, in simple heresy, if persons are found to show a reverent love for
       heretics, to receive consolation or communion from them, or perpetrate any other such
       matter in accordance with their rites and ceremonies: such persons would fall under and be
       convicted of a violent suspicion of heresy and heretical beliefs. (See many chapters on this
       subject in Book VI of the Canon.) For there is no doubt that such persons act in this way out
       of a belief in some heresy.
             It is the same, as regards the heresy of witches, with those who perform and persist in
       performing any of the actions which pertain to the rites of witches. Now these are of various

       kinds. Sometimes it is only some threatening speech, such as “You shall soon feel what will
       happen to you,” or something similar. Sometimes it is a touch, just laying their hands
       curiously on a man or a beast. Sometimes it is only a matter of being seen, when they show
       themselves by day or by night to others who are sleeping in their beds; and this they do
       when they wish to bewitch men or beasts. But for raising hailstorms they observe various
       other methods and ceremonies, and perform various ritual actions round about a river, as we
       have shown before where we discussed the manner and methods of working witchcraft.
       When such are found and are publicly notorious they are convicted of a violent suspicion of
       the heresy of witchcraft; especially when some effect of witchcraft has followed upon their
       actions, either immediately or after some interval. For then there is direct evidence when
       any instruments of witchcraft are found hidden in some place. And although when some
       interval of time has elapsed the evidence of the fact is not so strong, such a person still
       remains under strong suspicion of witchcraft, and therefore much more of simple heresy.
             And if it be asked whether the devil cannot inflict injury upon men and beasts without
       the means of a woman being seen in a vision or by her touch, we answer that he can, when
       God permits it. But the permission of God is more readily granted in the case of a creature
       that was dedicated to God, but by denying the faith has consented to other horrible crimes;
       and therefore the devil more often uses such means to harm creatures. Further, we may say
       that, although the devil can work without a witch, he yet very much prefers to work with
       one, for the many reasons which we showed earlier in this work.
             To sum up our conclusions on this matter, it is to be said that, following the above
       distinctions, those who are suspected of the heresy of witchcraft are separated into three
       categories, since some are lightly, some strongly, and some gravely suspected. And they are
       lightly suspected who act in such a way as to give rise to a small or light suspicion against
       hem of this heresy. And although, as has been said, a person who is found to be suspected in
       this way is not to be branded as a heretic, yet he must undergo a canonical purgation, or he
       must be caused to pronounce a solemn abjuration as in the case of one convicted of a slight
       heresy.
             For the Canon (cap. excommunicamus) says: Those who have been found to rest under
       a probable suspicion (that is, says Henry of Segusio, a light suspicion), unless, having
       respect to the nature of the suspicion and the quality of their persons, they should prove their
       innocent by a fitting purgation, they are to be stricken with the sword of anathema as a
       worthy satisfaction in the sight of all men. And if they continue obstinate in their
       excommunication for the period of a year, they are to utterly condemned as heretics.
             And note that, in the purgation imposed upon them, whether or not they consent to it,
       and whether or not they fail in it, they are throughout to be judged as reputed heretics on
       whom a canonical purgation is to be imposed.
             And that a person under this light suspicion can and should be caused to pronounce a
       solemn abjuration is shown in the chapter Accusatus, where it says: A person accused or
       suspected of heresy, against whom there is a strong suspicion of this crime, if he abjures the
       heresy before the Judge and afterwards commits it, then, by a sort of legal fiction, he shall
       be judged to have relapsed into heresy, although the heresy was not proved against him
       before his abjuration. But if the suspicion was in the first place a small or light one, although
       such a relapse renders the accused liable to severe punishment, yet he is not to suffer the
       punishment of those who relapse into heresy.
             But those who are strongly suspected, that is, those who have acted in such a way as to
       engender a great and strong suspicion; even those are not necessarily heretics or to be
       condemned as such. For it is expressly stated in the Canon that no one is to be condemned of
       so great a crime by reason of a strong suspicion. And it says:
             Therefore we order that, when the accused is only under suspicion, even if it be a
       strong one, we do not wish him to be condemned of so grave a crime; but such a one so
       strongly suspected must be commanded to abjure all heresy in general, and in particular that
       of which he is strongly suspected.
             But if he afterwards relapses either into his former heresy or into any other, or if he
       associates with those whom he knows to be witches or heretics, or visits them, receives,
       consults with, forgives, or favours them, he shall not escape the punishment of backsliders,
       according to the chapter Accusatus. For it says there: He who has been involved in one kind
       or sect of heresy, or has erred in one article of the faith or sacrament of the Church, and has
       afterwards specifically and generally abjured his heresy: if thereafter he follows another
       kind or sect of heresy, or errs in another article or sacrament of the Church, it is our will that
       he be judged a backslider. He, therefore, who is known to have lapsed into heresy before his
       abjuration, if after his abjuration he receives heretics, visits them, gives or sends them
       presents or gifts, or shows favour to them, etc., he is worthily and truly to judged a
       backslider; for by this proof there is no doubt that he was in the first place guilty. Such is the
       tenor of the Canon.
             From these words it is clear that there are three cases in which a person under strong
       suspicion of heresy shall, after his abjuration, be punished as a backslider. The first is when
       he falls back into the same heresy of which he was strongly suspected. The second is when
       he has abjured al heresy in general, and yet lapses into another heresy, even if he has never
       before been suspected or accused of that heresy. The third is when he receives and shows
       favour to heretics. And this last comprises and embraces many cases.
             But it is asked what should be done when a person who has fallen under so strong a
       suspicion steadily refuses to comply with his Judge’s order to abjure his heresy: is he to be
       at once handed over to the secular Court to be punished? We answer that by no means must
       this be done; for the Canon (ad abolendam) expressly speaks, not of suspects, but of those
       who are manifestly taken in heresy. And more rigorous action is to be employed against
       those who are manifestly taken than against those who are only suspected.
             And if it is asked, How then is such a one to be proceeded against? We answer that the
       Judge must proceed against him in accordance with the chapter excommunicamus, and he
       must be excommunicated. And if he continues obstinate after a year’s excommunication, he
       is to be condemned as a heretic.
             There are others again who are violently or gravely suspected, whose actions give rise
       to a violent suspicion against them; and such a one is to be considered as a heretic, and
       throughout he is to be treated as if he were taken in heresy, in accordance with the Canon
       Law. For these either confess their crime or not; and if they do, and wish to return to the
       faith and abjure their heresy, they are to be received back into penitence. But if they refuse
       to abjure, they are to be handed over to the secular Court for punishment.
             But if he does not confess his crime after he has been convicted, and does not consent
       to abjure his heresy, he is to be condemned as an impenitent heretic. For a violent suspicion
       is sufficient to warrant a conviction, and admits no proof to the contrary.
             Now this discussion deals with simple heresy, where there is no direct or indirect
       evidence of the fact, as will be shown in the sixth method of passing sentence, where a man
       is to be condemned as a heretic even though he may not actually be one: then how much
       more is it applicable to the heresy of witches, where there is always in addition either the
       direct evidence of bewitched children, men, or animals, or the indirect evidence of
       instruments of witchcraft which have been found.
             And although in the case of simple heresy those who are penitent and abjure are, as has
       been said, admitted to penitence and imprisonment for life; yet in this heresy, although the
       ecclesiastic Judge may receive the prisoner into penitence, yet the civil Judge can, because
       of her temporal injuries, that is to say, the harms she has done to men, cattle, and goods,
       punish her with death; nor can the ecclesiastic Judge prevent this, for even if he does not
       hand her over to be punished, yet he is compelled to deliver her up at the request of the civil
       Judge.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

            “Papiensis.” Bernardus Papiensis, a famous and prolific Italian canonist of the
        thirteenth century, who died 18 September, 1213. He was born at Pavia, studied law and
        theology at Bologna, was provost of the Cathedral of Pavia until 1191, Bishop of Faenza
        until 1198, and then Bishop of Pavia until his death. The most celebrated of his many works
        is the “Breuiarium extrauagantium” (later called “Compilatio prima antiqua”), a
        collection of canonical texts comprising ancient canons not inserted in the “Decretum” of
        Gratian, as also various later documents. The work was compiled between 1187 and 1191,
        and was edited by Friedberg, “Quinque compilationes antiquae,” Leipzig, 1882.



           “Huguccio.” Hugh of Pisa, a distinguished Italian canonist, who died in 1210. He was
        born at Pisa, but the date is unknown. He studied at Bologna, where later he professed
        Canon Law. In 1190 he became Bishop of Ferrara. Among his works are a “Liber
        deruationum” which treats of etymology. He also wrote a “Summa” on the “Decretum” of
        Gratian, which has been considered the most extensive and one of the most valuable
        commentaries of the time. There are, however, certain omissions, but these gaps were filled
        by the industry of Joannes de Deo.

                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                        PART III, THIRD HEAD, QUESTION XX.
                                        Of the First Method of Pronouncing Sentence

             SINCE, therefore, the accused is either found innocent and is to be altogether absolved,
       or is found only to be generally defamed as a heretic, or is found a proper subject for the
       questions and the torture on account of her reputation, or is found to be lightly suspected of
       heresy, or is found to be strongly or gravely suspected of heresy, or is found to be at the
       same time commonly defamed and suspected of heresy, or is found to have confessed her
       heresy and to be penitent but probably to have relapsed, or is found to have confessed her
       heresy and to be impenitent but not really to have relapsed, or is found to have confessed but
       by legitimate witnesses and otherwise legally to have been convicted of heresy, or is found
       to have been convicted of heresy but to have escaped or defiantly absented herself, or is
       found not to have done injury by witchcraft but to have removed bewitchments unfittingly
       and by unlawful means, or is found to be an archer-wizard or enchanter of weapons with the
       purpose of causing death, or is found to be a witch-midwife offerings infants to the devil in
       the manner of an enemy, or is found to make frivolous and fraudulent appeals with a view to
       saving her life:
             Therefore, if she is found to be entirely innocent, the final sentence shall be
       pronounced in the following manner:
             Here it is to be noted that the accused is found to be entirely innocent when, after the
       facts of the process have been diligently discussed in consultation with skilled lawyers, she
       cannot be convicted either by her own confession, or by the evidence of the fact, or by the
       production of legitimate witnesses (since they have disagreed upon the main issue); and
       when the accused has never before been suspected of or publicly defamed as regards that
       crime (but the case is different if she has been defamed as regards some other crime); and
       when there is no evidence of the fact against her. In such a case the following procedure is
       observed; for she is to be absolved by the Bishop or Judge by a sentence to the following
       effect:
             We N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such a town (or Judge, etc.), considering that
       you N. of such a place and such a Diocese have been accused before us of the crime of
       heresy and namely of witchcraft; and considering that this accusation was such as we could
       not pass over with connivent eyes, have condescended to inquire whether the aforesaid
       accusation can be substantiated as true, by calling witnesses, by examining you, and by
       using other means which are fitting according to the canonical sanctions. Wherefore having
       diligently seen and examined all that has been done and said in this case, and having had the
       counsel of learned lawyers and Theologians, and having repeatedly examined and inquired
       into all; sitting as Judges on this tribunal and having only God before our eyes and the truth
       of the case, and the Holy Gospels being placed before us that our judgement may proceed
       from the countenance of God and our eyes behold equity, we proceed to our definitive
       sentence in this way, invoking the name of Christ. Since by that which we have seen and
       heard, and has been produced, offered, done, and executed before us in this present case, we
       have not found that anything has legally been proved against you of those things of which
       you were accused before us, we pronounce, declare, and give it as our final sentence that no
       act has legally been proved to us against you by which you can or ought to be judged a
       heretic or witch of heresy. Wherefore by this present declaration, inquiry, and judgement,
       we freely discharge you. This sentence was given, etc.
            Let care be taken not to put anywhere in the sentence that the accused is innocent or
       immune, but that it was not legally proved against him; for if after a little time he should
       again be brought to trial, and it should be legally proved, he can, notwithstanding the
       previous sentence of absolution, then be condemned.
            Note also that the same method of absolution may be used in the case of one who is
       accused of receiving, protecting, or otherwise comforting and favouring heretics, when
       nothing is legally proved against him.
            A secular Judge commissioned by the Bishop shall use his own manner of
       pronouncement.

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                       PART III, THIRD HEAD, QUESTION XXI.
      Of the Second Method of Pronouncing Sentence, when the Accused is no more than Defamed

              THE second method of delivering judgement is to be employed when he or she who is
       accused, after a diligent discussion of the merits of the case in consultation with learned
       lawyers, is found to be no more than defamed as a heretic in some village, town, or
       province. And this is when the accused does not stand convicted either by her own
       confession, or by the evidence of the facts, or by the legitimate production of witnesses; nor
       has there been anything proved against her except that she is the subject of common
       aspersion: so that no particular act of witchcraft can be proved by which she can be brought
       under strong or grave suspicion, as that she has uttered threatening words, for example,
       “You will soon feel what will happen to you,” or something to that effect, and afterwards
       some injury has befallen the person or the cattle of the man she threatened.
              The following procedure, therefore, is to be employed in the case of such a one against
       whom nothing has been proved except public obloquy. In this case judgement cannot be
       delivered for the accused, nor can she be absolved as in the first method; but a canonical
       purgation must be imposed upon her. Therefore let the Bishop or his deputy, or the Judge,
       first take note that, in a case of heresy, it is not necessary that a person should be defamed
       only by good and respected people; for the calumniation uttered by common and simple folk
       carries equal weight.
              And the reason for this is, that the same persons who are admitted as accusers in a case
       of heresy are also admitted as detractors. Now any heretic can be accused by anybody,
       except his mortal enemies; therefore he can also be defamed by anybody.
              Therefore let the Bishop or Judge pronounce his sentence of canonical purgation in this
       or some similar manner:
              We N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such a city, or Judge of such a county, having
       diligently examined the merits of the process conducted by us against you N. of such a
       Diocese accused before us of the crime of heresy, etc. We have not found that you have
       confessed to or have been convicted of the aforesaid sin or that you are even lightly
       suspected of it, except that we find that truly and legitimately you are publicly defamed by
       both good and bad in such a village, town, or Diocese; and that you may be in good odour
       among the company of the faithful we impose upon you as by law a canonical purgation,
       assigning to you such a day of such a month at such hour of the day, upon which you shall
       appear in person before us with so many persons of equal station with you to purge you of
       your defamation. Which sponsors must be men of the Catholic faith and of good life who
       have known your habits and manner of living not only recently but in time past. And we
       signify that, if you should fail in this purgation, we shall hold you convicted, according to
       the canonical sanctions.
              Here it is to be considered that, when a person is duly found to be publicly defamed of
       some heresy, and nothing is proved against him except that defamation, a canonical
       purgation shall be imposed upon him. That is, he must produce some seven, ten, twenty, or
       thirty men, according to the extent to which he has been defamed and the size and important
       of the place concerned, and these must be men of his own station and condition. For
       example, if he who is defamed is a religious, they must be religious; if he is a secular, they
       must be seculars; if he be a solder, they must be soldiers who purge him from the crime for
       which he is defamed. And these sponsors must be men professing the Catholic faith and of
       good life, who have known his habits and life both recently and for a long time.
             But if he refuses this purgation, he must be excommunicated; and if he remains
       obstinate in that excommunication for a year, he is then to be condemned as a heretic.
             And if he accepts the purgation and fails in it; that is, if he cannot find sponsors of the
       number and quality desired; he shall be considered as convicted, and is to be condemned as
       a heretic.
             And it must here be remarked that, when it is said that he must purge himself by means
       of so many men of his own station in life, this is meant generically and not specifically.
       Thus, if a Bishop is to be purged, it is not necessary that all his sponsors should be Bishops;
       but Abbots and other religious who are priests are admitted; and similarly in other cases.
             And the defamed person shall purge himself in the following manner. At the time
       assigned to him for his canonical purgation, he shall appear in person with his sponsors
       before the Bishop who is his Judge, in the place where he is known to be defamed; and,
       placing his hand upon the Book of the Gospels set before him, he shall say as follows:
             I swear upon these four Holy Gospels of God that I never held, believed or taught,
       neither do I hold or believe such heresy (naming it) for which I am defamed.
             That is to say, he shall deny on oath whatever it is for which he is defamed.
             After this, all his sponsors shall place their hands on the Gospels; and each of them
       severally shall say: And I swear upon this Holy Gospel of God that I believe him to have
       sworn the truth. And then he is canonically purged.
             It is also to be noted that a person defamed of heresy is to be purged in the place where
       he is known to be defamed. And if he has been defamed in many places, he must be required
       to profess the Catholic faith and deny the heresy in all the places in which he is known as
       defamed.
             And let not such a person hold in light esteem this canonical purgation. For it is
       provided by the Canon Law that, if he afterwards falls into the heresy of which he has been
       purged, he is to be handed over as a backslider to the secular Court. But the case is
       somewhat different if he falls into some other heresy, of which he has not before been
       purged.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                       PART III, THIRD HEAD, QUESTION XXII.
 Of the Third Kind of Sentence, to be Pronounced on one who is Defamed, and who is to be put to the
                                             Question

             THE Third method of bringing a process on behalf of the faith to a conclusive
       termination is when the person accused of heresy, after a careful consideration of the merits
       of the process in consultation with learned lawyers, is found to be inconsistent in his
       statements, or is found that there are sufficient grounds to warrant his exposure to the
       question and torture: so that if, after he has been thus questioned, he confesses nothing, he
       may be considered innocent. And this is when the prisoner has not been taken in heresy, nor
       has he been convicted by his own confession, or by the evidence of the facts, or by the
       legitimate production of witnesses, and there are no indications that he is under such a
       suspicion as to warrant his being made to abjure the heresy; but nevertheless he is
       inconsistent in his answers when interrogated. Or there may be other sufficient reasons for
       exposing him to torture. And in such a case the following procedure is to be observed.
             And because such a judgement in includes an interlocutory sentence which must be
       against and not for the prisoner, the Inquisitor must not divide it into two sentences, but
       include it all in one. And in the first place, if the accused remains firm in his denials and can
       in no way be induced by honest men to confess the truth, the following manner of sentence,
       which is in some respects definitive, shall be used.
             We N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such a town, or Judge in the territory subject to
       the rule of such a Prince, having regard to the merits of the process conducted by us against
       you N., of such a place in such a Diocese, and after careful examination, find that you are
       not consistent in your answers, and that there are sufficient indications besides that you
       ought to be exposed to the question and torture. Therefore, that the truth may be known
       from your own mouth and that from henceforth you may not offend the ears of your Judges
       with your equivocations, we declare, pronounce, and give sentence that on this present day
       at such an hour you are to be subjected to an interrogatory under torture. This sentence was
       given, etc.
             If the person to be questioned is both found to be equivocal and at the same time there
       are other indications sufficient to warrant his being tortured, let both these facts be included
       in the sentence, as they are above. But if only one or the other of these hold good, let that
       one only be put in the sentence. But let the sentence be soon put into execution, or let them
       make as if to execute it. Nevertheless let not the Judge be too willing to subject a person to
       torture, for this should only be resorted to in default of other proofs. Therefore let him seek
       for other proofs; and if he cannot find them, and thinks it probable that the accused is guilty,
       but denied the truth out of fear, let him use other approved methods, always with due
       precautions, and by using the persuasions of the friends of the accused do his utmost to
       extract the truth from his own lips. And let him not hasten the business; for very often
       meditation, and the ordeal of imprisonment, and the repeated persuasion of honest men will
       induce the accused to discover the truth.
             But if, after keeping the accused in suspense, and after due and decent postponements
       of the time, and many exhortations of the accused, the Bishop and the Judge are well
       persuaded that, all circumstances considered, the accused is denying the truth, let them
       torture him slightly, without shedding blood, bearing in mind that torture is often fallacious
       and ineffective. For some are so soft-hearted and feeble-minded that at the least torture they
       will confess anything, whether it be true or not. Others are so stubborn that, however much
       they are tortured, the truth is not to be had from them. There are others who, having been
       tortured before, are the better able to endure it a second time, since their arms have been
       accomodated to the stretchings and twistings involved; whereas the effect on others is to
       make them weaker, so that they can the less easily endure torture. Others are bewitched, and
       make use of the fact in their torture, so that they will die before the will confess anything;
       for they become, as it were, insensible to pain. Therefore there is need for much prudence in
       the matter of torture, and the greatest attention is to be given to the condition of the person
       who is to be tortured.
             When, then, the sentence has been pronounced, the officers shall without delay prepare
       to torture the accused. And while they are making their preparations, the Bishop or Judge
       shall use his own persuasions and those of other honest men zealous for the faith to induce
       the accused to confess the truth freely, if necessary promising to spare his life, as we have
       shown above.
             But if the accused cannot thus be terrified into telling the truth, a second or third day
       may be appointed for the continuation of the torture; but it must not be repeated then and
       there. For such a repetition is not permissible unless some further indications against the
       accused should transpire. But there is nothing to prevent a continuation of the torture on
       another day.
             Let it be said: We N. Bishop and N. Judge (if he is present) aforesaid, assign to you N.
       such a day for the continuation of the torture, that the truth may be known from your own
       mouth. And let all be set down in the process. And during the interval appointed to him, let
       them use their own persuasions and those of other honest men to induce him to confess the
       truth.
             But if he has refused to confess, the torture can be continued on the day assigned, more
       or less severely according to the gravity of the offences in question. And the Judges will be
       able to observe many lawful precautions, both in word and deed, by which they may come
       at the truth; but these are more easily learned by use and experience and the variety of
       different cases than by the art of teaching of anyone.
             But if, after having been fittingly questioned and tortured, he will not discover the
       truth, let him not be further molested, but be freely allowed to depart. If, however, he
       confesses, and abides by his confession, and uncovers the truth, acknowledging his guilt and
       asking the pardon of the Church; then according to the Canon ad abolendam he is to be
       treated as one taken in heresy on his own confession, but penitent, and he must abjure the
       heresy, and sentence must be pronounced against him as in the case of those who are
       convicted by their own confession as being taken in heresy. This will be explained in the
       eighth method of sentencing such, to which the reader may refer.
             If, on the other hand, he confesses the truth, but is not penitent but obstinately persists
       in his heresy, but is not a relapsed heretic, then according to the Canon, after a decent
       interval and due warning, he is to be condemned as a heretic and handed over to the secular
       Court to suffer the extreme penalty, as we show later in the tenth method. But if he is a
       relapsed heretic, he is to be condemned in the way which is again explained in the tenth
       method, to which the reader may refer.
             But here it must be particularly noted that in some instances he who is to be questioned
       confesses nothing against himself before the torture, nor is anything proved on the strength
       of which he can be required to abjure the heresy or be condemned as a heretic; and in such
       cases the above procedure should be adopted, as we have said, immediately. But in other
       cases the accused is taken in heresy, or he is to be considered either lightly or strongly
       suspected; and he is not to be tortured in respect of such matters; but if, apart from these, he
       denies some points which are not proved, but of which there is sufficient indication to
       warrant his being tortured; and if, having been questioned as to these under torture, he
       confesses to none of them, he is not on that account to be absolved in accordance with the
       first method; but he must be proceeded against according to that which has been proved
       against him, and he or she must abjure the heresy as being one under suspicion of or taken in
       heresy, as the merits of the process may exact or require. And if, after torture, he confesses
       all or part of that for which he was tortured, then he must abjure both this and the former
       heresy which was proved against him, and sentence must be pronounced against him in
       respect of both of these.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                       PART III, THIRD HEAD, QUESTION XXIII.
            The Fourth Method of Sentencing, in the Case of one Accused upon a Light Suspicion

             THE fourth method of concluding the process on behalf of the faith is used when, after
       the merits of the process have been diligently examined in consultation with expert lawyers,
       the accused is found to rest under only a light suspicion of heresy. And this is when the
       accused is not taken in heresy, nor is convicted by her own confession or by the evidence of
       the facts or by the legitimate production of witnesses, and there are no other strong or
       vehement indications of heresy against her; but only a small and light indications of such a
       sort as, in the opinion of the Court, to engender a light suspicion against her. And such a one
       must be required to abjure the heresy of which she is accused; and then, if she relapses into
       heresy, she is not liable to the punishment of backsliders, although she must be more
       severely punished than would be the case if she had not previously abjured the heresy (see
       the Canon c. accusatus). The following procedure shall be followed in such a case. For such
       an accused, if the matter be a public one, will publicly make the following abjuration in the
       Church:
             I, N., of such a Diocese, a citizen of such a city or place, being on my trial, do swear
       before you the Lord Bishop of such a city, and upon the Holy Gospels placed before me and
       upon which I set my hand, that I believe in my heart and profess with my lips that Holy
       Catholic and Apostolic Faith which the Holy Roman Church believes, confesses, preaches,
       and observes. Also I swear that I believe in my heart and profess with my lips that the Lord
       JESUS Christ, in company with all the Saints, abominates the wicked heresy of witches; and
       that all who follow or adhere to it will with the devil and his Angels be punished in eternal
       fire unless they turn their hearts and are reconciled by the penitence of the Holy Church.
       And there I abjure, renounce, and revoke that heresy of which you, my Lord Bishop, and
       your Officers hold me suspected: namely, that I have been familiar with witches, have
       ignorantly defended their errors, have held in detestation their Inquisitors and prosecutors,
       or that I have failed to bring their crimes to light. Also I swear that I have never believed the
       aforesaid heresy, nor do I believe, nor have I adhered, nor do I adhered to it, nor shall I ever
       believe, adhere to, or teach it, nor do I intend to teach it. And if I should hereafter be guilty
       of any of the aforesaid practices (which God forbid), I shall willingly submit myself to the
       punishment provided by law for such who are so forsworn; and I am ready to undergo any
       penance which you see fit to enjoin me for those words or deeds of mine for which you hold
       me deservedly suspect; and I swear to fulfill such penance to the best of my strength, and to
       omit no part of it, so help me God and these Holy Gospels.
             The above abjuration shall be made in the common speech, so that all may understand
       it. And when it is done, the Judge, if he is present, or his deputy shall speak to her in the
       common speech to the following effect:
             My son (or daughter), you have not unworthily abjured the suspicion which we
       entertained of you, and have purged yourself by the aforesaid abjuration. Beware then lest
       hereafter you fall into the heresy you have abjured. For although, if you should repent, you
       would not be delivered up to the secular Court, since you made your abjuration as one under
       a light, and not a strong, suspicion, yet you wold then be far more severely punished than
       you would have been if you had not abjured, and you would then rest under a strong instead
       of a light suspicion. And when you should abjure as such, and afterwards should relapse,
       you would suffer the due punishment of a backslider, and would without mercy be delivered
       to the secular Court to endure the extreme penalty.
             But if she makes her abjuration secretly in the chamber of the Bishop or Judge, which
       will be the case when the matter is not a public one, she shall abjure in the same manner.
       And afterwards sentence shall be pronounced as follows:
             We, by the mercy of God Bishop of such a city, or (if he is present) Judge in the
       territory subject to such a Prince, having carefully seen and examined the merits of the
       process conducted by us against you N., accused before us heresy, find that you have
       committed such and such (naming them) which render you lightly suspected of heresy, on
       account of which we have judged it proper to cause you to abjure that heresy as one lightly
       suspected of it. But not for that can you be dismissed unpunished. And that you may become
       more careful in the future, having consulted with many eminent persons learned in the law
       and with religious men, and having carefully weighed and digested the whole matter, having
       only God before our eyes, and the irrefragable truth of the Holy Catholic Faith, and with the
       Holy Gospels placed before us that our sentence may proceed as from God’s countenance
       and that our eyes may see with equity, and sitting in tribunal as Judge, we condemn,
       sentence, or rather impose penance upon you N., standing in person here in our presence, in
       the following manner. Namely, that never hereafter shall you knowingly hold to, associate
       with, defend in your speech, read (if you are well learned), or hereafter, etc. and let there be
       set down that which she has committed, on account of which she was held suspected of the
       crime of heresy. This sentence and penance were given, etc.
             And let the Notary take care that he sets it down in the process that such abjuration was
       made as by one under a light, not a strong, suspicion of heresy; for otherwise great danger
       might ensue.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                      PART III, THIRD HEAD, QUESTION XXIV.
                     The Fifth Manner of Sentence, in the Case of one under Strong Suspicion

            THE fifth method of concluding a process on behalf of the faith is used when she who
       is accused of heresy, after a careful examination of the merits of the process in consultation
       with learned lawyers, is found to be strongly suspected of heresy. And this is when the
       accused is not legally taken in heresy, nor has been convicted by her own confession or by
       the evidence of the facts or by the legitimate production of witnesses; but strong and
       weighty indications have been proved against her by reason of which she is held to be under
       strong suspicion of heresy.
            The procedure in such a case is as follows. For such a person should abjure that heresy
       as one strongly suspected of it, in such a manner that, if she should afterwards relapse, she
       must be delivered to the secular Court to suffer the extreme penalty. And she shall make her
       abjuration publicly or secretly according to whether she is publicly or secretly suspected, or
       by more or less, high or low, as was just said in the case of one under a light suspicion; and
       she must abjure that specific heresy.
            And the preparations for such an abjuration should be as follows: - When the Sunday
       comes which has been fixed for the abjuration and the hearing of the sentence or the
       imposition of the penance, the preacher shall deliver a general sermon. After this, the Notary
       or clerk shall publicly read out the crimes of which the accused has been convicted, and
       those of which she is strongly suspected as a heretic.
            Then the Judge or his deputy shall say to her: Behold! according to that which has been
       read you are strongly suspected by us of such heresy; wherefore it behoves you to purge
       yourself and abjure the aforesaid heresy. And then the Book of the Gospels shall be placed
       before her, and she shall set her hand upon it; and if she can read competently, she shall be
       given the following written abjuration, and shall read it in the presence of the whole
       congregation.
            But if she cannot read competently, the Notary shall read it phrase by phrase, and the
       accused shall repeat it in a loud and audible voice in the following manner. The Notary or
       clerk shall say: I, N., of such a place, and the accused person shall repeat after him the same
       words, but always in the vulgar tongue. And so on up to the end of the abjuration. And she
       shall abjure in the following manner.
            I, N., of such a place in such a Diocese, standing my trial in person in presence of you
       reverend Lords the Bishop of such city and the Judge of the territory subject to the rule of
       such a Lord, upon the Holy Gospels set before me and touched by my hands, I swear that I
       believe in my heart and profess with my lips that Holy Catholic and Apostolic Faith which
       the Holy Roman Church teaches, professes, preaches, and holds. Also I swear that I believe
       in my heart and profess with my lips that, etc. And let her pronounce the Catholic article of
       the faith against that heresy of which she is strongly suspected.
              For example, if the heresy of witchcraft is in question, let her say as follows:
              I swear that I believe that not only will simple heretics and schismatics be tortured in
       fire everlasting, but that those above all will be so punished who are infected with the heresy
       of witches, who deny before the devil that faith which they received in Holy Baptism at the
       font, and practise demoniac lewdness for the fulfilment of their evil desires, inflicting all
       sorts of injuries upon men and animals and the fruits of the earth. And consequently I
       abjure, renounce, and revoke that heresy, or rather infidelity, which falsely and
       mendaciously maintains that there are no witches in the world, and that no one ought to
       believe that those injuries can be caused with the help of devils; for such infidelity is, as I
       now recognize, expressly contrary to the decision of our Holy Mother the Church and of all
       the Catholic Doctors, as also against the Imperial laws which have decreed that witches are
       to be burned.
              Also I swear that I have never persistently believed in the aforesaid heresy, neither do I
       believe nor adhere to it at the present, nor have I taught it, not intend to teach it, nor shall
       teach it. Also I swear and promise that I will never do or cause to be done such and such
       (naming them) of which you hold me strongly suspected as a heretic. And if hereafter
       (which God forbid) I should do any of the aforesaid, I am ready the undergo the punishment
       provided by law for backsliders; and I am ready to submit myself to any penance which you
       decide to impose upon me for those deeds and words of mine for which you hold me
       strongly suspected of the said heresy. And I swear and promise that I will perform it to the
       best of my strength, and will omit no part of it, so God and this Holy Gospel help me.
              And the said abjuration shall be made in the vulgar tongue so that it may be understood
       by all, unless it be made only in the presence of Clerics with a competent knowledge of the
       Latin tongue. But if the abjuration be made secretly in the Bishop's palace or chamber, when
       it is not a public matter, it shall be made in a similar manner. And afterwards the Bishop
       shall admonish her as above to beware lest she relapse and incur the penalty of a backslider.
       And let the Notary take care that he set it down how such abjuration was made by such a
       person as one strongly suspected of heresy, so that, if she should relapse, she may be
       punished as is proper for a backslider.
              And when this has been done, let the sentence or penance be pronounced in the
       following manner:
              We, N., Bishop of such city, and Brother N. (if he is present), Inquisitor of the sin of
       heresy in the domains subject to the rule of such a Prince, especially deputed by the Holy
       Apostolic See: having in mind that you, N., of such a place in such a Diocese, have done
       such and such (naming them), as lawfully appears from the carefully examined merits of the
       process, wherefore we reasonably hold you strongly suspected of such heresy, and have
       caused you to abjure it as one so suspected, being persuaded to that course by considerations
       of justice and the advice of men skilled in the law. But that you may be more careful in the
       future nor become more prone to the like practices, and that your crimes may not remain
       unpunished, and that you may be an example to other sinners; having consulted with many
       eminent and learned lawyers and Masters or Doctors of the faculty of Theology, having
       carefully digested the whole matter, and having before our eyes only God and the truth of
       the Catholic Apostolic Faith, having set before us the Holy Gospel that our judgement may
       proceed as from God's countenance and our eyes see with equity, and sitting in tribunal as
       Judges, we condemn, or rather impose penance in the following manner upon you, N.,
       standing here in person before us: namely, that you shall never hereafter presume to do, say,
       or teach such and such things. And let there be set down those things of which she has been
       convicted, and by reason of which she was strongly suspected of the aforesaid heresy, as
       well as certain others which, if she were to commit them, would make her guilty of a slight
       relapse into heresy; but this must be as the particular nature of the case demands and
       requires. As, for example, that she should never wittingly follow such practices, nor receive
       those whom she knows to have denied the faith, etc. This sentence was given, etc.
            But it must be noted that those who are suspected, but not taken in heresy, whether they
       be strongly or lightly suspected, must not be imprisoned or confined for life. For this is the
       punishment of those who have been heretics and afterwards repented. But they may, because
       of their deeds for which they have come under suspicion, be sent to prison for a time, and
       afterwards, as will be seen, released.
            Neither are they to be branded with the sign of the Cross, for such is the sign of a
       penitent heretic; and they are not convicted heretics, but only suspected, therefore they are
       not to be marked in this way. But they can be ordered either to stand on certain solemn days
       within the doors of a church, or near the altar, while Holy Mass is being celebrated, bearing
       in their hands a lighted candle of a certain weight; or else to go on some pilgrimage, or
       something of the kind, according to the nature and requirements of the case.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

           “A Certain Weight.” This was exactly specified when someone was delivered. Thus
        Urbain Grandier on 18 August, 1634, at Loudun, was sentenced “to make honourable
        amends, with bare head, a rope around his neck, and with a burning torch of two pounds’
        weight in his hand, before the principal door of the church of Saint-Pierre du Marché, and
        before that of Sainte Ursule of this town, and there, upon his knees, to ask pardon of God
        and the King.” His execution followed.




                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                       PART III, THIRD HEAD, QUESTION XXV.
                       The Sixth Kind of Sentence, in the Case of one who is Gravely Suspect

             THE sixth method of bringing to a conclusion a process on behalf of the faith is used
       when the person accused of heresy, after a careful examination of the merits of the process
       in consultation with learned lawyers, is found to be gravely suspected of heresy. And this is
       when the accused is not convicted of heresy by her own confession or by the evidence of the
       facts or by the legitimate productions of witnesses, but there are indications, not only light
       or even strong, but very strong and grave, which render her gravely suspected of the said
       heresy, and by reason of which she must be judged as one gravely suspected of the said
       heresy.
             And for a clearer understanding of this, we shall give examples both of a case of simple
       heresy and of the heresy of witches. For the case would fall under this head in simple heresy
       if the accused were not lawfully found convicted by his own confession, etc. as above, but
       for something which he had said or done. As, for example, he may have been summoned in
       a case not concerning the faith, and have been sentenced to excommunication; and if he
       should continue obstinate in excommunication for a year or more, he would come under a
       light suspicion of heresy; for such behaviour is not without some suspicion of heresy. But if
       he should then be summoned on a charge concerning the faith, and should not appear but
       contumaciously refuse to appear, and therefore be excommunicated, then he would be
       strongly suspected of heresy; for then the light suspicion would become a strong one. And if
       he remained obstinate in that excommunication for a year, then he would be gravely
       suspected of heresy; for then the strong suspicion would become a grave one, against which
       no defence is admitted. And from that time such a person would be condemned as a heretic,
       as is shown by the Canon, c. cum contumacia, lib. 6.
             An example of a grave suspicion in the heresy of witches would be when the accused
       has said or done anything which is practised by witches when they wish to bewitch anyone.
       And it commonly happens that they are constrained to manifest themselves by threatening
       words, by deeds, by a look or a touch, and this is for three reasons. First that their sins may
       be aggravated and more manifest to the their Judges; secondly, that they may be the more
       easily seduce the simple; and thirdly, that God may be the more offended and they may be
       granted more power of injuring men. Therefore a witch must be gravely suspected when,
       after she has used such threatening words as “I will soon make you feel,” or the like, some
       injury has befallen the person so threatened or his cattle. For then she is not to be considered
       as lightly suspected, as was the case with those who are familiar with witches, or those who
       wish to provoke someone to inordinate love. See above where we deal with the three
       degrees of suspicion, light, strong, and grave.
             Now we must consider what procedure is to be observed in such a case. For in the case
       of one gravely suspected of simple heresy, the following is the procedure. Although he may
       not in actual truth be a heretic, since there may not be any error in his understanding, or if
       there is, he may not cling obstinately to it in his will: nevertheless he is to be condemned as
       a heretic because of the said grave suspicion, against which no proof is admitted.
             Such a heretic is condemned in this manner. If he refuses to return and abjure his
       heresy and give fitting satisfaction, he is delivered to the secular Court to be punished. But if
       he is willing and consents, he abjures his heresy and is imprisoned for life. And the same
       holds good in the case of one gravely suspected of the heresy of witches.
             But although the same method in the main is to be observed in the case of one gravely
       suspected of the heresy of witches, there are some differences. It is to be noted that, if the
       witch maintains her denial, or claims that she uttered those words not with the implied
       intention but in a vehement and womanish passion; then the Judge has not sufficient warrant
       to sentence her to the flames, in spite of the grave suspicion. Therefore he must place her in
       prison, and cause inquiry to be made by proclamation whether she has been known to have
       done the like before. And if it is found that this is so, he must inquire whether she was then
       publicly defamed in respect of that heresy; and from this he can proceed further so that,
       before all else, she may be exposed to an interrogation under the question and torture. And
       then, if she shows signs of such heresy, or of the taciturnity of witches; as that she should be
       unable to shed tears, or remain insensible under torture and quickly recover her strength
       afterwards; then he may proceed with the various precautions which we have already
       explained where we dealt with such cases.
             And in case all should fail, then let him take note that, if she has perpetrated the like
       before, she is not to be altogether released, but must be sent to the squalor of prison for a
       year, and be tortured, and be examined very often, especially on the more Holy Days. But if,
       in addition to this, she has been defamed, then the Judge may proceed in the manner already
       shown in the case of simple heresy, and condemn her to the fire, especially if there is a
       multitude of witnesses and she had often been detected in similar or other deeds of
       witchcraft. But if he wishes to be merciful, he may set her a canonical purgation, that she
       should find twenty or thirty sponsors, sentencing her in such a way that, if she should fail in
       her purgation, she shall be condemned to the fire as convicted. And the Judge can proceed in
       such a manner.
             And if she should purge herself, then the Judge must sentence her to an abjuration of all
       heresy, on pain of the punishment for backsliders, together with the perpetual penance, in
       the following manner. The preparations for the abjuration will be the same as were
       explained in the fourth and fifth methods of concluding a process on behalf of the faith.
             Note that in all the following methods of pronouncing sentence, when the Judge wishes
       to proceed in a merciful manner he can act in the way we have already explained. But since
       secular Judges use their own various methods, proceeding with rigour but not always with
       equity, no fixed rule or method can be given for them as it can for an ecclesiastical Judge,
       who can receive the abjuration and impose a perpetual penance in the following manner:
             I, N., of such a place in such a Diocese, standing in person before you my venerable
       Lords the Bishop of such city and Judges, having touched with my hands the Holy Gospel
       placed before me, swear that I believe in my heart and profess with my lips the Holy
       Catholic and Apostolic Faith which the Holy Roman Church holds, professes, believes,
       preaches and teaches. And consequently I abjure all heresy, and renounce and revoke all
       who raise themselves against the Holy Roman and Apostolic Church, of whatever sect or
       error they be. Also I swear and promise that I shall never henceforward do, say, or cause to
       be done such and such (naming them) which I have done and said, and for which, in my
       guilt, you hold me gravely suspected of the said heresy. Also I swear and promise that I will
       perform every penance which you wish to impose upon me for the said crimes to the best of
       my strength, and that I will not omit any part of it, so help me God and the Holy Gospel.
       And if (which God forbid) I should hereafter act in contravention of this abjuration, I here
       and now bind and oblige myself to suffer the due punishments for backsliders, however
       sever they may be.
             Let the Notary take care to set it down that the said abjuration was made by one gravely
       suspected of heresy, so that if she should be proved to have relapsed, she should then be
       judged accordingly and delivered up to the secular Court.
             After this let the Bishop absolve her from the sentence of excommunication which she
       has incurred as one gravely suspected of heresy. For when a heretic returns to the faith and
       abjures his heresy, he is to be released from the sentence of excommunication which is
       passed on all heretics. Similarly, such a one as we are considering was condemned as a
       heretic, as we have said; but after she has abjured her heresy she is to be released from
       excommunication; and after this absolution she is to be sentenced in the following manner:
             We N., Bishop of such city, and, if he is present, Judge in the territory of such Lord,
       seeing that you N., of such a place in such a Diocese, have been accused before us of such
       and such touching the faith (naming them), and that we have proceeded to inform ourselves
       concerning them as justice demanded by a careful examination of the merits of the process
       and of all that has been done and said in the present case, have found that you have
       committed such and such (naming them). Wherefore, and not without reason holding you
       gravely suspected of such heresy (naming it), we have caused you as one so suspected
       publicly to abjure all heresy in general, as the canonical sanctions bid us. And since
       according to those same canonical institutions all such are to be condemned as heretics, but
       you holding to wiser counsel and returning to the bosom of our Holy Mother the Church
       have abjured, as we have said, all vile heresy, therefore we absolve you from the sentence of
       excommunication by which you were deservedly bound as one hateful to the Church of
       God. And if with true heart and faith unfeigned you have returned to the unity of the
       Church, you shall be reckoned from henceforth among the penitent, and as from now are
       received back into the merciful bosom of the Holy Church. But since it would be most
       scandalous to pass over with connivent eyes and leave unpunished your offences against
       God and your injuries to men, for it is a graver matter to offend the Divine Majesty than a
       human monarch, and that your crimes may not be an incentive for other sinners, and that
       you may become more careful in the future and less prone to commit again the aforesaid
       crimes, and may suffer the less punishment in the next world: We the aforesaid Bishop and
       Judge, having availed ourselves of the wise and considered advice of learned men in this
       matter, sitting in tribunal as Judges judging, having before our eyes only God and the
       irrefragable truth of the Holy Faith, with the Holy Gospels placed before us that our
       judgement may proceed as from the countenance of God and our eyes see with equity,
       sentence and condemn, or rather impose penance in the following manner upon you N.,
       appearing in person before us on the day and at the hour which was before assigned to you.
       First, you shall put on over all the garments which you wear a grey-blue garment after the
       manner of a monk’s scapulary, made without a hood either before or behind, and having
       upon it crosses of yellow cloth three palms long and two palms wide, and you shall wear
       this garment over all others for such a length of time (setting a period of one or two years,
       more or less as the guilt of the person demands), And in the said garment and crosses you
       shall stand in the door of such a church at such a time for so long, or on the four major
       Feasts of the Glorious Virgin, or in such and such cities in the doors of such and such
       churches; and we sentence and condemn you for life, or for such a period, to such a prison.
       (Let this be set down as seems most to the honour of the faith, and according to the greater
       or less guilt and obstinacy of the accused.) And we expressly, and in the sure knowledge
       that it is so ordained by canonical institution, reserve to ourselves the right to mitigate the
       said penance, to increase it, change it, or remove it, in whole or in part, as often as seems
       good to us. This sentence was given, etc.
             And when this has been read, it shall at once be duly put into execution, and she shall
       be clothed with the aforesaid garment with the crosses as has been said.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

           “Four Major Feasts.” Presumably the Annunciation, the Visitation, Assumption, and
        Nativity of Our Lady are intended. Candlemas, which in the Middle Ages had an octave in
        many dioceses, may be intended instead of the Visitiation. The last Pope, Sixtus IV, had in
        1470 published a work on the Immaculate Conception. By a decree of 28 February, 1476,
        this Pontiff adopted the Feast of Our Lady's Conception for the entire Latin Church and
        granted an indulgence to all who should assist at the Divine Office of this Solemnity.




                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                      PART III, THIRD HEAD, QUESTION XXVI.
                  The Method of passing Sentence upon one who is both Suspect and Defamed

             THE seventh method of bringing to a conclusion a process on behalf of the faith is
       employed when the person accused of the sin of heresy, after a careful examination of the
       merits of the process in consultation with men learned in the law, is found to be both
       suspected and defamed of heresy. And this is when the accused is not legally convicted by
       his own confession or by the evidence of the facts or by the legitimate production of
       witnesses; but is found to be publicly defamed, and there are also other indications which
       render him lightly or strongly suspected of heresy: as that he has held much familiarity with
       heretics. And such a person must, because of his defamation, undergo a canonical purgation;
       and because of the suspicion against him he must abjure the heresy.
             The procedure in such a case will be as follows. Such a person, being publicly defamed
       for heresy, and being in addition to this suspected of heresy by reason of certain other
       indications, shall first publicly purge himself in the manner which we explained in the
       second method. Having performed this purgation, he shall immediately, as one against
       whom there are other indications of the suspected heresy, abjure that heresy in the following
       manner, having before him, as before, the Book of the Gospels:
             I., N., of such a place in such a Diocese, standing my trial in person before you my
       Lords, N., Bishop of such city and Judge in the territory of such Prince, having touched with
       my hands the Holy Gospels placed before me, swear that I believe in my heart and profess
       with my lips that Holy Apostolic Faith which the Roman Church believes, professes,
       preaches and observes. And consequently I abjure, detest, renounce and revoke every heresy
       which rears itself up against the Holy and Apostolic Church, of whatever sect or error it be,
       etc., as above.
             Also I swear and promise that I will never hereafter do or say or cause to be done such
       and such (naming them), for which I am justly defamed as having committed them, and of
       which you hold be suspected. Also I swear and promise that I will perform to the best of my
       strength every penance which you impose on me, nor will I omit any part of it, so help me
       God and this Holy Gospel. And if hereafter I should act in any way contrary to this oath and
       abjuration (which God forbid), I here and now freely submit, oblige, and bind myself to the
       legal punishment for such, to the limit of sufferance, when it shall have been proved that I
       have committed such things.
             But it must be noted that when the indications are so strong as to render the accused,
       either with or without the aforesaid defamation, strongly suspected of heresy, then he shall,
       as above, abjure all heresy in general. And if he relapsed into any heresy, he shall suffer the
       due punishment of a backslider. But if the indications are so small and slight as, even taken
       together with the said defamation, not to render him strongly, but only lightly, suspected of
       heresy, then it is enough if he makes not a general abjuration, but specifically abjures that
       heresy of which he is suspected; so that, if he were to relapse into another form of heresy, he
       would not be liable to the penalty for backsliders. And even if he were to relapse into the
       same heresy which he had abjured, he would still not be liable to the said penalty, although
       he would be more severely punished than would have been the case if he had not abjured.
             But there is a doubt whether he would be liable to the penalty for backsliders if, after
       his canonical purgation, he should relapse into the same heresy of which he was canonically
       purged. And it would seem that this would be so, from the Canon Law, c. excommunicamus
       and c. ad abolendam. Therefore the Notary must take great care to set it down whether such
       a person has made his abjuration as one under a light or a strong suspicion of heresy; for, as
       we have often said, there is a great difference between these. And when this has been done,
       sentence or penance shall be pronounced in the following manner:
             We., N., Bishop of such city or Judge in the territories of such Prince, having diligently
       in mind that you, N., of such a place in such a Diocese, have been accused before us of such
       heresy (naming it); and wishing to inquire judicially whether you have fallen into the said
       heresy, by examining witnesses, by summoning and questioning you upon oath, and by all
       convenient means in our power, we have acted and proceeded as it behoved.
             Having digested, observed and diligently inspected all the facts, and having discussed
       the merits of the process of this case, examining al and singular which has been done and
       said, and having consulted with and obtained the mature opinion of many learned
       Theologians and lawyers, we find that you have been in such place or places publicly
       defamed by good and sober men for the said heresy; wherefore, as we are bidden by the
       canonical institutions, we have imposed upon you a canonical purgation by which you and
       your sponsors have here publicly purged yourself before us. We find also that you have
       committed such and such (naming them), by reason of which we have just cause t hold you
       strongly or lightly (let it be said whether it is one or the other) suspected of the said heresy;
       and therefore we have caused you to abjure heresy as one under such suspicion (here, if he
       has abjured as one under strong suspicion, let them say “all heresy”; and if as one under
       light suspicion, “the said heresy”).
             But because we cannot and must not in any way tolerate that which you have done, but
       are in justice compelled to abominate it, that you may become more careful in the future,
       and that your crimes may not remain unpunished, and that others may not be encouraged to
       fall into the like sins, and that the injuries to the Creator may not easily be passed over:
       Therefore against you, N., having so purged yourself and abjured, standing personally in our
       presence in this place at the time which was assigned to you, We, the aforesaid Bishop or
       Judge, sitting in tribunal as Judges judging, having before us the Holy Gospels that our
       judgement may proceed as from the countenance of God and our eyes see with equity,
       pronounce sentence or penance in the following manner, namely, that you must, etc.
             And let them pronounce sentence as shall seem most to the honour of the faith and the
       extermination of the sin of heresy: as that on certain Sundays and Festivals he must stand at
       the door of such a church, holding a candle of such a weight, during the solemnization of
       Holy Mass, with head uncovered and bare feet, and offer the said candle at the altar; and that
       he must fast on Fridays, and that for a certain period he must not dare to depart from that
       place, but present himself before the Bishop or Judge on certain days of the week; and any
       similar penance which seemed to be demanded by the particular nature of his guilt; for it is
       impossible to give a hard-and-fast rule. This sentence was given, etc. And let it be put into
       execution after it has been pronounced; and it can be cancelled, mitigated or changed as may
       be required by the condition of the penitent and for his correction and humiliation; for the
       Bishop has this power by law.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                       PART III, THIRD HEAD, QUESTION XXVII.
    The Method of passing Sentence upon one who hath Confessed to Heresy, but is still not Penitent

             The eighth method of terminating a process on behalf of the faith is used when the
       person accused of heresy, after a careful examination of the merits of the process in
       consultation with learned lawyers, is found to have confessed his heresy, but to be penitent,
       and not truly to have relapsed into heresy. And this is when the accused has himself
       confessed in a Court of law under oath before the Bishop and Inquisitor that he has for so
       long lived and persisted in that heresy of which he is accused, or in any other, and has
       believed in and adhered to it; but that afterwards, being persuaded by the Bishop and others,
       he wishes to be converted and to return to the bosom of the Church, and to abjure that and
       every heresy, and to make such satisfaction as they require of him; and it is found that he
       has made no previous abjuration of any other heresy, but is now willing and prepared to
       abjure.
             In such a case the procedure will be as follows. Although such a person has for many
       years persisted in the said heresy and even in others, and has believed and practised them
       and led many others into error; yet if at last he has consented to abjure those heresies and to
       make such satisfaction as the Bishop and the ecclesiastical Judge shall decree, he is not to be
       delivered up to the secular Court to suffer the extreme penalty; nor, if he is a cleric, is he to
       be degraded. But he is to admitted to mercy, according to the Canon ad abolendam. And
       after he has abjured his former heresy he is to be confined in prison for life (see the Canon
       excommunicamus, where it provides for the absolution of such). But great care must be
       taken that he has no simulated a false penitence in order to be received back into the Church.
       Also the secular Court is not at all bound by such a sentence as the above.
             He shall make his abjuration in the manner already set out, with this difference. He
       shall with his own mouth confess his crimes before the congregation in church on a Feast
       Day, in the following manner. The clerk shall ask him, have you for so many years persisted
       in the heresy of witches? And he shall answer, Yes. And then, Have you done this and this
       to which you have confessed? And he shall answer, Yes. And so on. And finally he shall
       make his abjuration kneeling on his knees. And since, having been convicted of heresy, he
       has been excommunicated, after he has by abjuration returned to the bosom of the Church,
       he is to be granted the grace of absolution, according to the manner used by the Bishops
       with Apostolic authority of absolving from the major excommunication. And sentence shall
       at once be pronounced in the following manner:
             We, the Bishop of such city, or the Judge in the territories of such Prince, seeing that
       you, N., of such a place in such a Diocese, have been by public report and the information of
       credible persons accused before us of the sin of heresy; and since you had for many years
       been infected with that heresy to the great damage of your soul; and because this accusation
       against you has keenly wounded our hearts: we whose duty it is by reason of the office
       which we have received to plant the Holy Catholic Faith in the hearts of men and to keep
       away all heresy from their minds, wishing to be more certainly informed whether there was
       any truth in the report which had come to our ears, in order that, if it were true, we might
       provide a healthy and fitting remedy, proceeded in the best way which was open to us to
       question and examine witness and to interrogate you on oath concerning that of which you
       were accused, doing all and singular which was required of us by justice and the canonical
       sanctions.
             And since we wished to bring your case to a suitable conclusion, and to have a clear
       understanding of your past state of mind, whether you were walking in the darkness or in the
       light, and whether or not you had fallen into the sin of heresy; having conducted the whole
       process, we summoned together in council before us learned men of the Theological faculty
       and men skilled in both the Canon and the Civil Law, knowing that, according to canonical
       institution, the judgement is sound which is confirmed by the opinion of many; and having
       on all details consulted the opinion of the said learned men, and having diligently and
       carefully examined all the circumstances of the process; we find that you are, by your own
       confession made on oath before us in the Court, convicted of many of the sins of witches.
       (Let them be expressed in detail.)
             But since the Lord in His infinite mercy permits men at times to fall into heresies and
       errors, not only that learned Catholics may be exercised in sacred arguments, but that they
       who have fallen from the faith may become more humble thereafter and perform works of
       penitence: having carefully discussed the circumstances of this same process, we find that
       you, at our frequent instance and following the advice of us and other honest men, have with
       a healthy mind returned to the unity and bosom of the Holy Mother Church, detesting the
       said errors and heresies, and acknowledging the irrefragable truth of the Holy Catholic
       Faith, laying it t your inmost heart: wherefore, following in His footsteps Who wishes that
       no one should perish, we have admitted you to this adjuration and public abjuration of the
       said an all other heresies. And having done this, we absolve you from the sentence of major
       excommunication by which you were bound for your fall into heresy, and reconciling you to
       the Holy Mother Church we restore you to the sacraments of the Church; provided that with
       a true heart, and not with simulated faith, you return to the unity of the Church, as we
       believe and hope that you have done.
             But because it would be a very scandalous thing to avenge the injuries done to temporal
       Lords and to tolerate the offences committed against God the Creator of all the Heavens,
       since it is a far greater sin to offend against the Eternal than against a temporal Majesty, and
       that God Who pities sinners may have mercy upon you, that you may be an example for
       others, and that your sins may not remain unpunished, and that you may become more
       careful in the future, and not more prone but less apt to commit the said and any other
       crimes: We the said Bishop and Judge, or Judges, on behalf of the faith, sitting in tribunal as
       Judges judging, etc., as above . . . that you put on a grey-blue garment, etc. Also we
       sentence and condemn you to perpetual imprisonment, there to be punished with the bread
       of affliction and the water of distress; reserving to ourselves the right to mitigate, aggravate,
       change, or remit wholly or in part the said sentence if, when, and as often as it shall seem
       good to us to do so. This sentence was given, etc.
             After this the Judge shall proceed point by point, pronouncing sentence in the
       following or some similar manner:

            My son, your sentence or penance consists in this, that you bear this cross during the
       whole period of your life, that you stand so bearing it on the altar steps or in the door of such
       churches, and that you be imprisoned for life on bread and water. But, my son, lest this may
       seem too hard for you, I assure you that if you patiently bear your punishment you will find
       mercy with us; therefore doubt not nor despair, but hope strongly.
            After this, let the sentence be duly executed, and let him put on the said garment and be
       placed on high upon the altar steps in full view of the people as they go out, surrounded by
       the officers of the secular Court. And at the dinner hour let him be led by the officers to
       prison, and the rest of the sentence be carried out and duly performed. And after he is led
       out through the door of the church, let the ecclesiastical Judge have no more to do with the
       matter; and if the secular Court be satisfied, it is well, but if not, let it do its pleasure.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                        PART III, THIRD HEAD, QUESTION XVIII.
 The Method of passing Sentence upon one who hath Confessed to Heresy but is Relapsed, Albeit now
                                            Penitent

             THE ninth method of arriving at a conclusive sentence in a process on behalf of the
       faith is used when the person accused of heresy, after a careful investigation of the
       circumstances of the process in consultation with men of good judgement, is found to have
       confessed her heresy and to be penitent, but that she has truly relapsed. And this is when the
       accused herself confesses in Court before the Bishop or Judges that she has at another time
       abjured all heresy, and this is legally proved, and that she has afterwards fallen into such a
       heresy or error: or that she has abjured some particular heresy, such as that of witches, and
       has afterwards returned to it; but that following better advice she is penitent, and believes
       the Catholic faith, and returns to the unity of the Church. Such a one is not, if she humbly
       ask for them, to be denied the sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist; but however much
       she may repent, she is nevertheless to be delivered up as a backslider to the secular Court to
       suffer the extreme penalty. But it must be understood that this refers to one who had made
       her abjuration as one manifestly taken in heresy, or as one strongly suspected of heresy, and
       not to one who has so done as being under only a light suspicion.
             The following procedure must be observed in this case. When, after mature and careful
       and, if necessary, repeated investigation by learned men, it has been concluded that the said
       prisoner has actually and prepense relapsed into heresy, the Bishop or Judge shall send to
       the said prisoner in the place of detention two or three honest men, especially religious or
       clerics, who are zealous for the faith, of whom the prisoner has no suspicion, but rather
       places confidence in them; and they shall go in to her at a suitable time and speak to her
       sweetly of the contempt of this world and the miseries of this life, and of the joys and glory
       of Paradise. And leading up from this, they shall indicate to her on the part of the Bishop or
       Judge that she cannot escape temporal death, and that she should therefore take care for the
       safety of her soul, and prepare herself to confess her sins and receive the Sacrament of the
       Eucharist. And they shall visit her often, persuading her to penitence and patience,
       strengthening her as much as they can in the Catholic truth, and they shall diligently cause
       her to confess, so that she may receive the Sacrament of the Eucharist at her humble
       petition. For these Sacraments are not to be denied to such offenders.
             And when she has received these Sacraments, and been well disposed by these men to
       salvation; after two or three days during which they have strengthened her in the Catholic
       faith and induced her to repentance, the Bishop or Judge of that place shall notify the bailiff
       of the place or the authorities of the secular Court, that on such a day at such an hour (not a
       Feast Day) he should be with his attendants in such a square or place (but it must be outside
       a church) to receive from their Court a certain backslider whom the Bishop and Judge will
       hand over to him.
             And on the morning of the day fixed, or on the day before, it shall be publicly
       proclaimed throughout the city of place in those towns and villages where such
       proclamations are customary, that on such a day at such an hour in such a place there will be
       a sermon preached in defence of the Faith, and that the Bishop and other Judges will
       condemn a certain person who has relapsed into the sin of heresy, delivering her up to
       secular justice.
             But here it must be considered that, if he who has so relapsed should have been
       ordained in any Holy Orders, or should be a priest or a religious of any Order, before he is
       handed over he is to be degraded and stripped of the privileges of his ecclesiastic order. And
       so, when he has been degraded from all ecclesiastical office, let him be handed over to
       secular justice to receive his due punishment.
             When, therefore, such a one is to be degraded from his orders and handed over to the
       secular Court, let the Bishop summon together all the prelates and religious men of his
       Diocese. For in this case, though not in others, only the Bishop together with the other
       prelates and religious and learned men of his diocese can degrade one who has received
       Holy Orders when he is to be delivered to the secular Court, or is to be imprisoned for life
       for the sin of heresy.
             On the day appointed for the degrading of the backslider and the handing of him over
       to the secular Court, if he be a cleric, or, if he be a layman, for leaving him to hear his
       definitive sentence, the people shall gather together in some square or open place outside the
       church, and the Inquisitor shall preach a sermon, and the prisoner shall be set on a high
       place in the presence of the secular authorities. And if the prisoner be a cleric who is to be
       degraded, the Bishop shall don his Pontifical robes, together with the other prelates of his
       Diocese in their vestments and copes, and the prisoner shall be clothed and robed as if he
       were to minister his office; and the Bishop shall degrade him from his order, beginning from
       the higher and proceeding to the lowest. And just as in conferring Holy Orders the Bishop
       uses the words ordained by the Church, so in degrading him he shall take off his chasuble
       and stole, and so with the other vestments, using words of a directly opposite meaning.
             When this degradation has been accomplished, the proceedings must continue in the
       legal and accustomed manner, and the Notary or religious or clerk shall be bidden to read
       the sentence, which shall be after the following manner, whether the prisoner be a layman or
       a degraded cleric:
             We, N., by the mercy of the God Bishop of such city, and Judge in the territories of
       such Prince, seeing that we are legitimately informed that you, N., of such a place in such a
       Diocese, have been before us (or before such Bishop and Judges) accused of such heresy or
       heresies (naming them), of which you were lawfully convicted by your own confession and
       by witnesses, and that you had obstinately persisted in them for so long, but afterwards,
       listening to better advice, publicly in such a place abjured, renounced and revoked those
       heresies in the form provided by the Church, on which account the said Bishop and
       Inquisitor, believing that you had truly returned to the bosom of the Holy Church of God,
       did absolve you from the sentence of excommunication by which you were bound, enjoining
       upon you a salutary penance if with true heart and faith unfeigned you had returned to the
       unity of the Holy Church; but whereas after all the aforesaid and the lapse of so many years
       you are again accused before us and have again fallen into such heresies which you had
       abjured (naming them), and though it was sore grief to us to hear such things of you, yet we
       were by justice compelled to investigate the matter, to examine the witnesses, and to
       summon and question you on oath, proceeding in each and every way as we are bidden by
       the canonical institutions.
             And since we wished to conclude this case without any doubt, we convened in solemn
       council learned men of the Theological faculty and men skilled in the Canon and the Civil
       Law, and in consultation with them maturely and carefully examined all and singular which
       had been done, said and seen in the process and diligently discussed each circumstance,
       weighing all equally in the balance as it behoved us; and we find both by the legitimate
       evidence of witnesses and by your own confession received in Court that you have fallen
       into the heresies which you had abjured. For we find that you have said or done such and
       such (let all be named), on account of which, with the concurrence of the said learned men,
       we have judged and now judge that you are a backslider, according tot he canonical
       institutions, to which we refer in grief and grieve to refer.
             But since it has come to the knowledge of Us and of many honest Catholic men that, by
       the inspiration of Divine grade, you have once more returned to the bosom of the Church
       and to the truth of the faith detesting the aforesaid errors and heresies and with true
       orthodoxy unfeigned believing and protesting the Catholic faith, we have admitted you to
       receive the Church's Sacraments of Penance and the Holy Eucharist at your humble request.
       But since the Church of God has no more which it can do in respect of you, seeing that it has
       acted so mercifully towards you in the manner we have said, and you have abused that
       mercy by falling back into the heresies which you had abjured: therefore We the said Bishop
       and Judges, sitting in tribunal as Judges judging, having before us the Holy Gospels that our
       judgement may proceed as from the countenance of God and our eyes see with equity, and
       having before our eyes only God and the irrefragable truth of the Holy Faith and the
       extirpation of the plague of heresy; against you, N., in this place on the day and at the hour
       before assigned to you for the hearing of your definitive sentence, we pronounce in sentence
       that you have truly fallen back into the sin of heresy, although you are penitent; and as one
       truly so relapsed we cast you forth from this our ecclesiastical Court, and leave you to be
       delivered to the secular arm. But we earnestly pray that the said secular Court may temper
       its justice with mercy, and that there be no bloodshed or danger of death.
             And here the Bishop and his assessors shall withdraw, and the secular Court shall
       perform its office.
             It is to be noted that, although the Bishop and Inquisitor ought to use their utmost
       diligence, both by their own efforts and those of others, to induce the prisoner to repent and
       return to the Catholic faith; yet, after he has repented and it has been decided in council that,
       though he is penitent, he is nevertheless truly a backslider and as such to be handed over in
       person to the secular Court, they ought not to inform him of such sentence and punishment.
       therefore from that time, neither before nor after the sentence should they present
       themselves before him, that he be not moved in his spirit against them, a thing which is very
       carefully to be avoided in death of this sort. But, as we have said, let them send to him some
       honest men, especially those in religious orders, or clerics, in whom he has confidence; and
       let them inform him of the sentence to come and of his death, and strengthen him in the
       faith, exhorting him to have patience; and let them visit him after the sentence, and console
       him and pray with him, and not leave him until he has rendered his spirit to his Creator.
             Let them, therefore, beware and be on their guard not to do or say anything which may
       enable the prisoner to anticipate his death, or place themselves in an irregular position. And,
       as they have burdened themselves with the care of his soul, let them then share also in his
       punishment and guilt.
            It must also be remarked that such a sentence which delivers up a person to the secular
       Court ought not to be pronounced on a Festival or Solemn Day, nor in a church, but outside
       in some open space. For it is a sentence which leads to death; and it is more decent that it
       should be delivered on an ordinary day and outside the church; for a Feast Day and the
       church are dedicated to God.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                                      PART III, THIRD HEAD, QUESTION XXIX.
The Method of passing Sentence upon one who hath Confessed to Heresy but is Impenitent, although not
                                            Relapsed

             THE tenth method of completing a process on behalf of the Faith by a final sentence is
       used when the person accused of heresy, after a careful examination of the circumstances of
       the process in consultation with skilled lawyers, is found to have confessed his heresy and to
       be impenitent, though he has not relapsed into the heresy. Such a case is very rarely found,
       but yet it has come within the experience of us Inquisitors. In such a case, therefore, the
       Bishop and Judge must not be in haste to sentence the prisoner, but must keep him well
       guarded and fettered, and induce him to be converted, even to the extent of several months,
       showing him that, by remaining impenitent, he will be damned in body and soul.
             But if neither by comforts nor hardships, nor by threatening nor persuasion, can he be
       brought to renounce his errors, and the appointed period of grace has expired, let the Bishop
       and Judges prepare to deliver or abandon him to the secular Court; and they shall give notice
       to the herald or bailiff or secular authorities that on such a day, not a Feast, and at such an
       hour they should be in such a place with their attendants outside a church, and that they will
       deliver to them a certain impenitent heretic. None the less they shall themselves make public
       proclamation in the customary places that on such a day at such a time in the aforesaid place
       a sermon will be preached in defence of the faith, and that they will hand over a certain
       heretic to secular justice; and that all should come and be present, being granted the
       customary Indulgences.
             After this, the prisoner shall be delivered to the secular Court in the following manner.
       But let him first be often admonished to renounce his heresy and repent; but if he altogether
       refuses, let the sentence be pronounced.
             We, N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such a city, or Judge in the territories of such
       Prince, seeing that you, N., of such a place in such a Diocese, have been accused before us
       by public report and the information of credible persons (naming them) of heresy, and that
       you have for many years persisted in those heresies to the great hurt of your immortal soul;
       and since we, whose duty it is to exterminate the plague of heresy, wishing to be more
       certainly informed of this matter and to see whether you walked in darkness or the light,
       have diligently inquired into the said accusation, summoning and duly examining you, we
       find that you are indeed infected with the said heresy.
             But since it is the chief desire of our hearts to plant the Holy Catholic Faith in the
       hearts of our people, and to eradicate the pest of heresy, we have used diverse and various
       suitable methods, both by ourselves and by others, to persuade you to renounce your said
       errors and heresies in which you had stood, were standing, and even now defiantly and
       obstinately stand with stubborn heart. But since the Enemy of the human race is present in
       your heart, wrapping you up and entangling you in the said errors, and you have refused and
       yet refuse to abjure the said heresies, choosing rather the death of your soul in hell and of
       your body in this world than to renounce the said heresies and return to the bosom of the
       Church and cleanse your soul, and since you are determined to remain in your sin:
             Therefore inasmuch as you are bound by the chain of excommunication from the Holy
       Church, and are justly cut off from the number of the Lord's flock, and are deprived of the
       benefits of the Church, the Church can do no more for you, having done all that was
       possible. We the said Bishop and Judges on behalf of the Faith, sitting in tribunal as Judges
       judging, and having before us the Holy Gospels that our judgement may proceed as from the
       countenance of god and our eyes see with equity, and having before our eyes only God and
       the truth of the Holy Faith and the extirpation of the plague of heresy, on this day and at this
       hour and place assigned to you for the hearing of your final sentence, we give it as our
       judgement and sentence that you are indeed an impenitent heretic, and as truly such to be
       delivered and abandoned to the secular Court: wherefore by this sentence we cast you away
       as an impenitent heretic from our ecclesiastical Court, and deliver or abandon you to the
       power of the secular Court: praying the said Court to moderate or temper its sentence of
       death against you. This sentence was given, etc.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                       PART III, THIRD HEAD, QUESTION XXX.
                    Of One who has Confessed to Heresy, is Relapsed, and is also Impenitent

             THE eleventh method of concluding and terminating a process on behalf of the Faith is
       used when the person accused of heresy, after a diligent discussion of the circumstances of
       the process in consultation with learned men, is found to have confessed her heresy, and to
       be impenitent, and to have relapsed into it. And this is when the accused confesses with her
       own mouth in Court that she believes and has practiced such and such. The procedure in this
       case is the same as that above; and because she is manifestly a heretic, sentence shall be
       pronounced in the following manner in the presence of the Bishop and Judges:
             We N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such city, or Judge in the territories of such
       Prince, seeing that you N., of such a place in such a Diocese, were formerly accused before
       us (or before such and such, our predecessors) of the crime of heresy (naming them), and
       that you were legally convicted of that crime by your own confession and the testimony of
       worthy men, and that you obstinately persisted in it for so many years; but that afterwards,
       having listened to better advice, you publicly abjured those heresies in such a place and in
       the form required by the Church, on which account the aforesaid Bishop and Judge,
       believing that you had truly renounced the said errors and had returned with Catholic faith to
       the bosom of the Church, granted you the benefit of absolution, releasing you from the
       sentence of excommunication by which you were formerly bound, and, setting you a
       salutary penance if with true heart and faith unfeigned you remained converted to the unity
       of the Holy Church, received you back in mercy. For the Holy Church of God is not closed
       to such as return to her bosom.
             But after all the aforesaid you have to our great grief been accused before us of having
       again fallen into those damnable heresies which you formerly abjured in public; yea, you
       have done so and so (naming them) in contravention of the said abjuration and to the
       damage of your soul; and although we are sore wounded and cut to the heart to have heard
       such things of you, yet we were in justice compelled to inquire into the matter, to examine
       the witnesses, and to summon and question you on oath as it behoved us, and in every
       particular to proceed as we are bidden by the canonical institutions. And as we wished to
       conclude this case beyond any doubt, we summoned a solemn council of men learned in the
       Theological faculty and of those skilled in the Canon and Civil Laws.
             And having obtained the mature and considered judgement of the said learned men
       upon every single particular which had been brought to notice and done in this case, after
       repeated examination of the whole process and careful and diligent discussion of every
       circumstance, as law and justice demanded, we find that you are legally convicted both by
       the evidence of credible witnesses and by your own repeated confession, that you have
       fallen, and fallen again, into the heresies which you abjured. For we find that you have said
       or done such and such (naming them), wherefore we have reason, in the opinion of the said
       learned men, and compelled thereto by your own excesses, to judge you as a backslider
       according to the canonical decrees. And that we say this with grief, and grieve to say it, He
       knows from Whom nothing is hid and Who seeth into the secrets of all hearts. And with all
       our hearts we desired and still desire to lead you back to the unity of the Holy Church and to
       drive out from your heart the said foul heresy, that so you may save your soul and preserve
       your body and soul from the destruction in hell, and we have exerted our utmost endeavor
       by various fitting methods to convert to salvation; but you have been given up to your sin
       and led away and seduced by an evil spirit, and have chosen to be tortured with fearful and
       eternal torment in hell, and that your temporal body should here be consumed in the flames,
       rather than to give ear to better counsels and renounce your damnable and pestilent errors,
       and to return to the merciful bosom of our Holy Mother Church.
             Wherefore since the Church of God can do nothing more for you, having done all that
       was possible to convert you: We the Bishop and Judges named in this cause on behalf of the
       faith, sitting in tribunal as Judges judging, having before us the Holy Gospels that our
       judgement may proceed as from the countenance of God and our eyes see with equity, and
       having before our eyes only God and the honour of the Holy Catholic Faith, on this day at
       this hour and place before assigned to you for the hearing of your final sentence, we
       pronounce judgement upon you N., here present before us, and condemn and sentence you
       as a truly impenitent and relapsed heretic, and as such to be delivered or abandoned to
       secular justice; and by this our definitive sentence we cast you out as a truly impenitent and
       relapsed heretic from our ecclesiastical Court, and deliver and abandon you to the power of
       the secular Court; praying that the said secular Court will temper or moderate its sentence of
       death against you. This sentence was give, etc.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                      PART III, THIRD HEAD, QUESTION XXXI.
                                  Of One Taken and Convicted, but Denying Everything

             THE twelfth method of finishing and concluding a process on behalf of the faith is used
       when the person accused of heresy, after a diligent examination of the merits of the process
       in consultation with skilled lawyers, is found to be convicted of heresy by the evidence of
       the facts or by the legitimate production of witnesses, but not by his own confession. That is
       to say, he may be convicted by the evidence of the facts, in that he has publicly practiced
       heresy; or by the evidence of witnesses against whom he can take no legitimate exception;
       yet, though so taken and convicted, he firmly and constantly denies the charge. See Henry of
       Segusio On Heresy, question 34.
             The procedure in such a case is as follows. The accused must be kept in strong durance
       fettered and chained, and must often be visited by the officers, both in a body and severally,
       who will use their own best endeavours and those of others to induce him to discover the
       truth; telling him that if he refuses and persists in his denial, he will in the end be abandoned
       to the secular law, and will not be able to escape temporal death.
             But if he continues for a long time in his denials, the Bishop and his officers, now in a
       body and now severally, now personally and now with the assistance of other honest and
       upright men, shall summon before them now one witness, now another, and warm him to
       attend strictly to what he has deposed, and to be sure whether or not he has told the truth;
       that he should beware lest in damning another temporally he damn himself eternally; that if
       he be afraid, let him at least tell them the truth in secret, that the accused should not die
       unjustly. And let them be careful to talk to him in such a way that they may see clearly
       whether or not his depositions have been true.
             But if the witnesses, after this warning, adhere to their statements, and the accused
       maintains his denials, let not the Bishop and his officers on that account be in any haste to
       pronounce a definitive sentence and hand the prisoners over to secular law; but let them
       detain him still longer, now persuading him to confess, now yet again urging the witnesses
       (but one at a time) to examine their consciences as well. And let the Bishop and his officers
       pay particular attention to that witness who seems to be of the best conscience and the most
       disposed to good, and let them more insistently charge him on his conscience to speak the
       truth whether or not the matter was as he had deposed. And if they see any witness vacillate,
       or there are any other indications that he has given false evidence, let them attest him
       according to the counsel of learned men, and proceed as justice shall require.
             For it is very often found that after a person so convicted by credible witnesses has
       long persisted in his denials, he has at length relented, especially on being truly informed
       that he will not be delivered to the secular Court, but be admitted to mercy if he confesses
       his sin, and he has then freely confessed the truth which he had so long denied. And it is
       often found that the witnesses, actuated by malice and overcome by enmity, have conspired
       together to accuse an innocent person of the sin of heresy; but afterwards, at the frequent
       entreaty of the Bishop and his officers, their consciences have been stricken with remorse
       and, by Divine inspiration, they have revoked their evidence and confessed that they have
       out of malice put that crime upon the accused. Therefore the prisoner in such a case is not to
       be sentenced hastily, but must be kept for a year or more before he is delivered up to the
       secular Court.
             When a sufficient time has elapsed, and after all possible care has been taken, if the
       accused who has been thus legally convicted has acknowledged his guilt and confessed in
       legal from that he hath been for the period stated ensnared in the crime of heresy, and has
       consented to abjure that and every heresy, and to perform such satisfaction as shall seem
       proper to the Bishop and Inquisitor for one convicted of heresy both by his own confession
       and the legitimate production of witnesses; then let him as a penitent heretic publicly abjure
       all heresy, in the manner which we have set down in the eighth method of concluding a
       process on behalf of the faith.
             But if he has confessed that he hath fallen into such heresy, but nevertheless obstinately
       adheres to it, he must be delivered to the secular Court as an impenitent, after the manner of
       the tenth method which we have explained above.
             But if the accused has remained firm and unmoved in his denial of the charges against
       him, but the witnesses have withdrawn their charges, revoking their evidence and
       acknowledging their guilt, confessing that they had put so great a crime upon an innocent
       man from motives of rancour and hatred, or had been suborned or bribed thereto; then the
       accused shall be freely discharged, but they shall be punished as false witnesses, accusers or
       informers. This made clear by Paul of Burgos in his comment on the Canon c. multorum.
       And sentence or penance shall be pronounced against them as shall seem proper to the
       Bishop and Judges; but in any case such false witnesses must be condemned to perpetual
       imprisonment on a diet of bread and water, and to do penance for all the days of their life,
       being made to stand upon the steps before the church door, etc. However, the Bishops have
       power to mitigate or even to increase the sentence after a year or some other period, in the
       usual manner.
             But if the accused, after a year or other longer period which has been deemed
       sufficient, continues to maintain his denials, and the legitimate witnesses abide by their
       evidence, the Bishop and Judges shall prepare to abandon him to the secular Court; sending
       to him certain honest men zealous for the faith, especially religious, to tell him that he
       cannot escape temporal death while he thus persists in his denial, but will be delivered up as
       an impenitent heretic to the power of the secular Court. And the Bishop and his officers
       shall give notice to the Bailiff or authority of the secular Court that on such a day at such an
       hour and in such a place (not inside a church) he should come with his attendants to receive
       an impenitent heretic whom they will deliver to him. And let him make public proclamation
       in the usual places that all should be present on such a day at such an hour and place to hear
       a sermon preached on behalf of the faith, and that the Bishop and his officer will hand over a
       certain obstinate heretic to the secular Court.
             On the appointed day for the pronouncement of sentence the Bishop and his officer
       shall be in the place aforesaid, and the prisoner shall be placed on high before the assembled
       clergy and people so that he may be seen by all, and the secular authorities shall be present
       before the prisoner. Then sentence shall be pronounced in the following manner:
             We, N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such city, or Judge in the territories of such
       Prince, seeing that you, N., of such a place in such a Diocese, have been accused before us
       of such heresy (naming it); and wishing to be more certainly informed whether the charges
       made against you were true, and whether you walked in darkness or in the light; we
       proceeded to inform ourselves by diligently examining the witnesses, by often summoning
       and questioning you on oath, and admitting an Advocate to plead in your defence, and by
       proceeding in every way as we were bound by the canonical decrees.
             And wishing to conclude your trial in a manner beyond all doubt, we convened in
       solemn council men learned in the Theological faculty and in the Canon and Civil Laws.
       And having diligently examined and discussed each circumstance of the process and
       maturely and carefully considered with the said learned men everything which has been said
       and done in this present case, we find that you, N., have been legally convicted of having
       been infected with the sin of heresy for so long a time, and that you have said an done such
       and such (naming them) on account of which it manifestly appears that you are legitimately
       convicted of the said heresy.
             But since we desired, and still desire, that you should confess the truth and renounce
       the said heresy, and be led back to the bosom of Holy Church and to the unity of the Holy
       Faith, that so you should save your soul and escape the destruction of both your body and
       soul in hell; we have by our own efforts and those of others, and by delaying your sentence
       for a long time, tried to induce you to repent; but you being obstinately given over to
       wickedness have scorned to agree to our wholesome advice, and have persisted and do
       persist with stubborn and defiant mind in your contumacious and dogged denials; and this
       we say with grief, and grieve and mourn in saying it. But since the Church of God has
       waited so long for you to repent and acknowledge your guilt, and you have refused and still
       refuse, her grace and mercy can go no farther.
             Wherefore that you may be an example to others and that they may be kept from all
       such heresies, and that such crimes may not remain unpunished: We the Bishop and Judges
       named on behalf of the faith, sitting in tribunal as Judges judging, and having before us the
       Holy Gospels that our judgement may proceed as from the countenance of God and our eyes
       see with equity, and having before our eyes only God and the glory and honour of the Holy
       Faith, we judge, declare and pronounce sentence that you standing here in our presence on
       this day at the hour and place appointed for the hearing of your final sentence, are an
       impenitent heretic, and as such to be delivered or abandoned to secular justice; and as an
       obstinate and impenitent heretic we have by this sentence cast you off from the
       ecclesiastical Court and deliver and abandon you to secular justice and the power of the
       secular Court. And we pray that the said secular Court may moderate its sentence of death
       upon you. this sentence was given, etc.
             The Bishop and Judges may, moreover, arrange that just men zealous for the faith,
       known to and in the confidence of the secular Court, shall have access to the prisoner while
       the secular Court is performing its office, in order to console him and even yet induce him to
       confess the truth, acknowledge his guilt, and renounce his errors.
             But if it should happen that after the sentence, and when the prisoner is already at the
       place where he is to be burned, he should say that he wishes to confess the truth and
       acknowledge his guilt, and does so; and if he should be willing to abjure that and every
       heresy; although it may be presumed that he does this rather from fear of death than for love
       of the truth, yet I should be of the opinion that he may in mercy be received as a penitent
       heretic and be imprisoned for life. See the gloss on the chapters ad abolendam and
       excommunicamus. Nevertheless, according to the rigour of the law, the Judges ought not to
       place much faith in a conversion of this sort; and furthermore, they can always punish him
       on account of the temporal injuries which he has committed.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                       PART III, THIRD HEAD, QUESTION XXXII.
            Of One who is Convicted but who hath Fled or who Contumaciously Absents himself

            THE Thirteenth and last method of arriving at a definite sentence in a process on behalf
       of the Faith is used when the person accused of heresy, after a diligent discussion of the
       merits of the process in consultation with learned lawyers, is found to be convicted of
       heresy, but has made his escape, or defiantly absents himself after the expiration of a set
       time. And this happens in three cases.
            First, when the accused is convicted of heresy by his own confession, or by the
       evidence of the facts, or by the legitimate production of witnesses, but has fled, or has
       absented himself and refused to appear after being legally summoned.
            Secondly, when a person has been accused and certain information has been laid
       against him on account of which he rests under some suspicion, even if it be only a light
       one, and he has been summoned to answer for his faith; and because he has defiantly refused
       to appear, he is excommunicated, and has stubbornly remained in that excommunication for
       a year, and always defiantly absents himself.
            The third case is when someone directly obstructs the Bishop's or Judge's sentence or
       process on behalf of the Faith, or lends his help, advice or protection for that purpose, and
       such a person has been stricken with the sword of excommunication. And if he was
       obstinately endured that excommunication for a year, he is then to be condemned as a
       heretic who has defied the administration of justice.
            In the first case, such a person is, according to the Canon ad abolendam, to be
       condemned as an impenitent heretic. In the second and third cases he is not to be judged as
       an impenitent heretic, but to be condemned as if he were a penitent heretic. And in any of
       these cases the following procedure should be observed. When such a person has been
       awaited for sufficient time, let him be summoned by the Bishop and his officer in the
       Cathedral Church of that Diocese in which he has sinned, and in the other churches of that
       place where he had his dwelling, and especially from where he has fled; and let him be
       summoned in the following manner:
            We, N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such Diocese, having in our charge the welfare
       of souls, and having above all the desires of our heart this most earnest desire that in our
       time in the said Diocese the Church should flourish and that there should be a fruitful and
       abundant harvest in that vineyard of the Lord of Hosts, which the right hand of the Most
       High Father has planted in the bosom of the righteous, which the Son of that Father has
       plentifully watered with His own life-giving Blood, which the reviving Spirit the Paraclete
       has made fruitful within by His wonderful and ineffable gifts, which the whole
       incomprehensible and ineffable Blessed Trinity has endowed and enriched with many very
       great and holy privileges; but the wild boar out of the forest, by which is meant any sort of
       heretic, has devoured and despoiled it, laying waste the fair fruit of the faith and planting
       thorny briars among the vines; and that tortuous serpent, the evil enemy of our human race,
       who is Satan and the devil, has breathed out venom and poisoned the fruit of the vineyard
       with the plague of heresy: And this is the field of the Lord, the Catholic Church, to till and
       cultivate which the only first-born Son of God the Father descended from the heights of
       Heaven, and sowed it with miracles and Holy discourse, going through towns and villages
       and teaching not without great labour; and He chose as His Apostles honest labouring men,
       and showed them the way, endowing them with eternal rewards; and the Son of God
       Himself expects to gather from that field on the Day of the Last Judgement a plentiful
       harvest, and by the hands of His Holy Angels to store it in His Holy barn in Heaven: But the
       foxes of Samson, two-faced like them who have fallen into the sin of heresy, having their
       faces looking both ways but tied together by their burning tails, run about with many torches
       amidst the fields of the Lord now white unto harvest and shining with the splendour of the
       faith, and bitterly despoil them, speeding most cunningly here and there, and with their
       strong attacks burning, dissipating, and decastation, and subtly and damnably subverting the
       truth of the Holy Catholic Faith.
             Wherefore, since you, N., are fallen into the damned heresies of witches, practising
       them publicly in such place (naming it), and have been by legitimate witnesses convicted of
       the sin of heresy, or by your own confession received by us in Court; and after your capture
       you have escaped, refusing the medicine of your salvation: therefore we have summoned
       you to answer for the said crimes in person before us, but you, led away and seduced by a
       wicked spirit, have refused to appear.
                                                               Or as follows:
             Wherefore, since you, N., have been accused before us of the sin of heresy, and from
       information received against you we have judged that you are under a light suspicion of that
       sin, we have summoned you to appear personally before us to answer for the Catholic faith.
       And since, having been summoned, you have defiantly refused to appear, we
       excommunicated you and caused you to be proclaimed excommunicate. And in this state
       you have remained stubborn for a year, or so many years, hiding here and there, so that even
       now we do not know whither the evil spirit has led you; and though we have awaited you
       kindly and mercifully, that you might return to the bosom and the unity of the Holy Faith,
       you being wholly given up to evil have scorned to do so. Yet we wish and are bound to
       justice to conclude this case beyond any question, now can we pass over with connivent
       eyes your iniquitous crimes.
             We the Bishop and Judges in the said cause on behalf of the faith require and strictly
       command by this our present public edict that you the aforesaid, at present in hiding and
       runaway and fugitive, shall on such a day of such a month in such a year, in such Cathedral
       Church of such Diocese, at the hour of Terce appear personally before us to hear your final
       sentence: signifying that, whether you appear or not, we shall proceed to our definitive
       sentence against you as law and justice shall require. And that our summons may come to
       your knowledge beforehand and you may not be able to protect yourself with a plea of
       ignorance, we wish and command that our said present letters, requisition and summons be
       publically affixed to the doors of the said Cathedral Church. In witness of all which we have
       ordered these our present letters to be authorized by the impressions of our seals. Given, etc.
             On the appointed day assigned for the hearing of the final sentence, if the fugitive shall

       have appeared and consented to abjure publicly all heresy, humbly praying to be admitted to
       mercy, he is to be admitted if he has not been a backslider; and if he was convicted by his
       own confession or by the legitimate production of witnesses, he shall abjure and repent as a
       penitent heretic, according to the manner explained in the eighth method of concluding a
       process on behalf of the faith. If he was gravely suspected, and refused to appear when he
       was summoned to answer for his faith, and was therefore excommunicated and had endured
       that excommunication obstinately for a year, but becomes penitent, let him be admitted, and
       abjure all heresy, in the manner explained in the sixth method of pronouncing sentence. But
       if he shall appear, and not consent to abjure, let him be delivered as a truly impenitent
       heretic to the secular Court, as was explained in the tenth method. But if he still defiantly
       refuses to appear, let the sentence be pronounced in the following manner:
             We, N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such city, seeing that you, N., of such a place
       in such a Diocese were accused before us by public report and the information of worthy
       men of the sin of heresy: We, whose duty it is, proceeded to examine and inquire whether
       there was any truth in the report which had come to our ears. And finding that you were
       convicted of heresy by the depositions of many credible witnesses, we commanded that you
       be brought before us in custody. (Here let it be said whether he had appeared and been
       questioned under oath or not.) But afterwards, led away and seduced by the advice of the
       evil spirit, and fearing to have your wounds wholesomely healed with wine and oil, you fled
       away (or, if it was the case, You broke from your prison and place of detention and fled
       away), hiding here and there, and we are altogether ignorant of whither the said evil spirit
       has led you.
                                                          Or after this manner:
            And finding that against you, accused as aforesaid before us of the sin of heresy, there
       were many indications by reason of which we judged you to be lightly suspected of the said
       heresy, we summoned you by public edict in such and such churches of such Diocese within
       a certain time assigned to appear in person before to answer to the said charges against you
       and otherwise on matter concerning the Faith. But you, following some mad advice,
       obstinately refused to appear. And when, as in justice bound, we excommunicated you and
       caused you to be publicly proclaimed excommunicate, you stubbornly remained in that
       excommunication for more than a year, and kept hidden here and there, so that we do not
       know whither the evil spirit has led you.
            And where the Holy Church of God has long awaited you up to this present day in
       kindness and mercy, that you might fly to the bosom of her mercy, renouncing your errors
       and professing the Catholic Faith, and be nourished by the bounty of her mercy; but you
       have refused to consent, persisting in your obstinacy; and since we wished and still wish, as
       we ought to do and as justice compels us, to bring your case to an equitable conclusion, we
       have summoned you to appear in person before us on this day at this hour and place, to hear
       your final sentence. And since you have stubbornly refused to appear, you are manifestly
       proved to abide permanently in your errors and heresies; and this we say with grief, and
       grieve in saying it.
            But since we cannot and will not delay to do justice, nor may we tolerate so great
       disobedience and defiance of the Church of God; for the exaltation of the Catholic Faith and
       the extirpation of vile heresy, at the call of justice, and by reason of your disobedience and

       obstinacy, on this day and at this hour and place heretofore strictly and precisely assigned to
       you for the hearing of your final sentence, having diligently and carefully discussed each
       several circumstance of the process with learned men in the Theological faculty and in the
       Canon and Civil Laws, sitting in tribunal as Judges judging, having before us the Holy
       Gospels that our judgement may proceed as from the countenance of God and our eyes see
       with equity, and having before our eyes only God and the irrefragable truth of the Holy
       Faith, and following in the footsteps of the Blessed Apostle Paul, in these writings we
       pronounce final sentence against you, N., absent or present, as follows, invoking the Name
       of Christ.
             We the Bishop and Judges named on behalf of the Faith, whereas the process of this
       cause on behalf of the Faith has in all things been conducted as the laws require; and
       whereas you, having been legally summoned, have not appeared, and have not by yourself
       or any other person excused yourself; and whereas you have for a long time persisted and
       still obstinately persist in the said heresies, and have endured excommunication in the cause
       of the Faith for so many years, and still stubbornly endure it; and whereas the Holy Church
       of God can do no more for you, since you have persisted and intend to persist in your
       excommunication and said heresies: Therefore, following in the footsteps of the Blessed
       Apostle Paul, we declare, judge and sentence you, absent or present, to be a stubborn
       heretic, and as such to be abandoned to secular justice. And by this our definitive sentence
       we drive you from the ecclesiastical Court, and abandon you to the power of the secular
       Court; earnestly praying the said Court that, if ever it should have you in its power, it will
       moderate its sentence of death against you. This sentence was give, etc.
             Here it is to be considered that, if that stubborn fugitive had been convicted of heresy,
       either by his own confession or by credible witnesses, and had fled before his abjuration, he
       is by the sentence to be judged an impenitent heretic, and so it must be expressed in the
       sentence. But if, on the other hand, he had not been convicted, but had been summoned as
       one under suspicion to answer for his faith; and, because he has refused to appear, has been
       excommunicated, and has obstinately endured that excommunication for more than a year,
       and has finally refused to appear; then he is not to be judged a heretic, but as a heretic, and
       must be condemned as such; and so it must be expressed in the sentence,as it is said above.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                                     THE
                             MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                                  PART III, QUESTION XXXIII.
Of the Method of passing Sentence upon one who has been Accused by another Witch, who has been or is
                                      to be Burned at the Stake.

              The fourteenth method of finally concluding a process on behalf of the Faith is used
        when the person accused of heresy, after a careful discussion of the circumstances of the
        process with reference to the informant in consultation with learned lawyers, is found to be
        accused of that heresy only by another witch who has been or is to be burned. And this can
        happen in thirteen ways in thirteen cases. For a person so accused is either found innocent
        and is to be freely discharged; or she is found to be generally defamed for that heresy; or it
        is found that, in addition to her defamation, she is to be to some degree exposed to torture;
        or she is found to be strongly suspected of heresy; or she is found to be at the same time
        defamed and suspected; and so on up to thirteen different cases, as was shown in the
        Twentieth Question.
              The first case is when she is accused only by a witch in custody, and is not convicted
        either by her own confession or by legitimate witnesses, and there are no other indications
        found by reason of which she can truly be regarded as suspect. In such a case she is to be
        entirely absolved, even by the secular Judge himself who has either burned the deponent or
        is about to burn her either on his own authority or on that commissioned to him by the
        Bishop and Judge of the Ordinary Court; and she shall be absolved in the manner explained
        in the Twentieth Question.
              The second case is when, in addition to being accused by a witch in custody, she is also
        publicly defamed throughout the whole village or city; so that she has always laboured
        under that particular defamation, but, after the deposition of the witch, it has become
        aggravated.
              In such a case the following should be the procedure. The Judge should consider that,
        apart from the general report, nothing particular has been proved against her by other
        credible witnesses in the village or town; and although, perhaps, that witch has deposed
        some serious charges against her, yet, since has lost her faith by denying it to the devil,
        Judges should give no ready credence to her words, unless there should be other
        circumstances which aggravate that report; and then the case would fall under the third and
        following case. Therefore she should be enjoined a canonical purgation, and the sentence
        should be pronounced as shown in the Twenty-first Question.
              And if the civil Judge orders this purgation to the be made before the Bishop, and ends
        with a solemn declaration that, if she should fail, then, as an example to others, she should
        be more severely sentenced by both the ecclesiastical and civil Judges, well and good. But if
        he wishes to conduct it himself, let him command her to find ten or twenty compurgators of
        her own class, and proceed in accordance with the second method of sentencing such:
        except that, if she has to be excommunicated, then he must have recourse to the Ordinary;

       and this would be the case if she refused to purge herself.
             The third case, then, happens when the person so accused is not convicted by her own
       confession, not by the evidence of the facts, nor by credible witnesses, nor are there any
       other indications as to any fact in which she had ever been marked by the other inhabitants
       of that town or village, except her general reputation among them. But the general report has
       become intensified by the detention of that witch in custody, as that it is said that she had
       been her companion in everything and had participated in her crimes. But even so, the
       accused firmly denies all this, and nothing of it is known to other inhabitants, or of anything
       to save good behaviour on her part, though her companionship with the witch is admitted.
             In such a case the following is the procedure. First they are to be brought face to face,
       and their mutual answers and recriminations noted, to see whether there is any inconsistency
       in their words by reason of which the Judge can decide from her admissions and denials
       whether he ought to expose her to torture; and if so, he can proceed as in the third manner of
       pronouncing a sentence, explained in the Twenty-second Question, submitting her to light
       tortures: at the same time exercising every possible precaution, as we explained at length
       towards the beginning of this Third Part, to find out whether she is innocent or guilty.
             The fourth case is when a person accused in this manner is found to be lightly
       suspected, either because of her own confession or because of the depositions of the other
       witch in custody. There are some who include among those who should be thus lightly
       suspected those who go and consult witches for any purpose, or have procured for
       themselves a lover by stirring up hatred between married folk, or have consorted with
       witches in order to obtain some temporal advantage. But such are to be excommunicated as
       followers of heretics, according to the Canon c. excommunicamus, where it says: Similarly
       we judge those to be heretics who believe in their errors. For the effect is presumed from the
       facts. Therefore it seems that such are to be more severely sentenced and punished than
       those who are under a light suspicion of heresy and are to be judged from light conjectures.
       For example, if they had performed services for witches or carried their letters to them, they
       need not on that account believe in their errors: yet they have not laid information against
       them, and they have received wages and vails from them. But whether or not such people
       are to be included in this case, according to the opinion of learned men the procedure must
       be as in the case of those under light suspicion, and the Judge will act as follows. Such a
       person will either abjure heresy or will purge herself canonically, as was explained in the
       fourth method of pronouncing sentence in the Twenty-third Question.
             However, it seems that the better course is for such a person to be ordered to abjure
       heresy, for this is more in accordance with the meaning of the Canon c. excommunicamus,
       where it speaks of those who are found to be only under some notable suspicion. And if
       such should relapse, they should not incur the penalty for backsliders. The procedure will be
       as above explained in the fourth method of sentencing.
             The fifth case is when such person is found to be under a strong suspicion, by reason,
       as before, of her own confession or of the depositions of the other witch in custody. In this
       class some include those who directly or indirectly obstruct the Court in the process of
       trying a witch, provided that they do this wittingly.
             Also they include all who give help, advice or protection to those who cause such
       obstructions. Also those who instruct summoned or captured heretics to conceal the truth or
       in some way falsify it. Also all those who wittingly receive, or visit those whom they know
       to be heretics, or associate with them, send them gifts, or show favour to them; for all such
       actions, when done with full knowledge, bespeak favour felt towards the sin, and not to the
       person. And therefore they say that, when the accused is guilty of any of the above actions,
       and has been proved so after trial, then she should be sentenced in the fifth method,
       explained in the Twenty-fourth Question; so that she must abjure all heresy, under pain of
       being punished as a backslider.
             As to these contentions we may say that the Judge must take into consideration the
       household and family of each several witch who has been burned or is detained; for these
       are generally found to be infected.
             For witches are instructed by devils to offer to them even their own children; therefore
       there can be no doubt that such children are instructed in all manner of crimes, as is shown
       in the First Part of this work.
             Again, in a case of simple heresy it happens that, on account of the familiarity between
       heretics who are akin to each other, when one is convicted of heresy it follows that his
       kindred also are strongly suspected; and the same is true of the heresy of witches.
             But this present case is made clear in the chapter of the Canon inter sollicitudines. For
       a certain Dean was, owing to his reputation as a heretic, enjoined a canonical purgation; on
       account of his familiarity with heretics, he had to make a public abjuration; and through the
       scandal he was deprived of his benefice, so that the scandal might be allayed.
             The sixth case is when such a person is under a grave suspicion; but no simple and bare
       deposition by another witch in custody can cause this, for there must be in addition some
       indication of the facts, derived from certain words or deeds uttered or committed by the
       witch in custody, in which the accused is at least said to have taken some part, and shared in
       the evil deeds of the deponent.
             To understand this, the reader should refer to what was written in the Nineteenth
       Question, especially concerning the grave degree of suspicion, how it arise from grave and
       convincing conjectures; and how the Judge is forced to believe, on mere suspicion, that a
       person is a heretic, although perhaps in his heart he is a true Catholic. The Canonists give an
       example of this by the case, in simple heresy, of a man summoned to answer in the cause of
       the faith, and defiantly refusing to appear, on which account he is excommunicated, and if
       he persists in that state for a year, becomes gravely suspected of heresy.
             And so likewise in the case of person accused in the way we are considering, the
       indications of the facts are to be examined by which she is rendered gravely suspect. Let us
       put the case that the witch in custody has asserted that the accused has taken part in her evil
       works of witchcraft, but the accused firmly denies it. What then is to be done? It will be
       necessary to consider whether there are any facts to engender a strong suspicion of her, and
       whether that strong suspicion can become a grave one. Thus, if a man has been summoned
       to answer some charge, and has obstinately refused to appear, he would come under a light
       suspicion of heresy, even if he had not been summoned in a cause concerning the Faith. But
       if he then refused to appear in a cause concerning the Faith and was excommunicated for his
       obstinacy, then he would be strongly suspected; for the light suspicion would become a
       strong one; and if then he remained obstinate in excommunication for a year, the strong
       suspicion would become a grave one. Therefore the Judge will consider whether, by reason
       of her familiarity with the witch in custody, the accused is under a strong suspicion, in the
       manner shown in the fifth case above; and then he must consider whether there is anything
       which may turn that strong suspicion into a grave one. For it is presumed that it is possible
       for this to be the case, on account of the accused having perhaps shared in the crimes of the
       detained witch, if she has had frequent intercourse with her. Therefore the Judge must
       proceed as in the sixth method of sentencing explained in the Twenty-fifth Question. But it
       may be asked what the Judge is to do if the person so accused by a witch in custody still
       altogether persists in her denials, in spite of all indications against her. We answer as
       follows:
             First the Judge must consider whether those denials do or do not proceed from the vice
       or witchcraft of taciturnity: and, as was shown in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Questions of
       this Third part, the Judge can know this from her ability or inability to shed tears, or from
       her insensibility under torture and quick recovery of her strength afterwards. For then the
       grave suspicion would be aggravated; and in such a case she is by no means to be freely
       discharged, but, according to the sixth method of sentencing, she must be condemned to
       perpetual imprisonment and penance.
             But if she is not infected with the taciturnity of witches, but feels the keenest pains in
       her torture (whereas others, as has been said, become insensible to pain owing to the
       witchcraft of taciturnity), then the Judge must fall back upon his last expedient of a
       canonical purgation. And if this should be ordered by a secular Judge, it is called a lawful
       vulgar purgation, since it cannot be classed with other vulgar purgations. And if she should
       fail in this purgation she will be judged guilty.
             The seventh case is when the accused is not found guilty by his own confession, by the
       evidence of the facts, or by legitimate witnesses, but is only found to be accused by a witch
       in custody, and there are also some indications found which bring him under light or strong
       suspicion. As, for example, that he had had great familiarity with witches; in which case he
       would, according to the Canon, have to undergo a canonical purgation on account of the
       general report concerning him; and on account of the suspicion against him he must abjure
       heresy, under pain of being punished as a backslider if it was a strong suspicion, but not if it
       was a light one.
             The eighth case occurs when the person so accused is found to have confessed that
       heresy, but to be penitent, and never to have relapsed. But here it is to be noted that in this
       and the other cases, where it is a question of those who have or have not relapsed, and who
       are or are not penitent, these distinctions are made only for the benefit of Judges who are not
       concerned with the infliction of the extreme penalty. Therefore the civil Judge may proceed
       in accordance with the Civil and Imperial Laws, as justice shall demand, in the case of one
       who has confessed, no matter whether or not she be penitent, or whether or not she have
       relapsed. Only he may have recourse to those thirteen methods of pronouncing sentence, and
       act in accordance with them, if any doubtful question should arise.
                                                                 Page 1 of 1

                                  THE
                          MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                        PART III, THIRD HEAD, QUESTION XXXIV.
Of the Method of passing Sentence upon a Witch who Annuls Spells wrought by Witchcraft; and of Witch
                                   Midwives and Archer-Wizards

              THE fifteenth method of bringing a process on behalf of the faith to a definitive
        sentence is employed when the person accused of heresy is not found to be one who casts
        injurious spells of witchcraft, but one who removes them; and in such a case the procedure
        will be as follows. The remedies which she uses will either be lawful or unlawful; and if
        they are lawful, she is not to be judged a witch but a good Christian. But we have already
        shown at length what sort of remedies are lawful.
              Unlawful remedies, on the other hand, are to be distinguished as either absolutely
        unlawful, or in some respect unlawful. If they are absolutely unlawful, these again can be
        divided into two classes, according as they do or do not involve some injury to another
        party; but in either case they are always accompanied by an expressed invocation of devils.
        But if they are only in some respect unlawful, that is to say, if they are practised with only a
        tacit, and not an expressed, invocation of devils, such are to be judged rather vain than
        unlawful, according to the Canonists and some Theologians, as we have already shown.
              Therefore the Judge, whether ecclesiastical or civil, must not punish the first and last of
        the above practices, having rather to commend the first and tolerate the last, since the
        Canonists maintain that it is lawful to oppose vanity with vanity. But he must by no means
        tolerate those who remove spells by an expressed invocation of devils, especially those who
        in doing so bring some injury upon a third part; and this last is said to happen when the spell
        is taken off one person and transferred to another. And we have already made it clear in a
        former part of this work that it makes no difference whether the person to whom the spell is
        transferred be herself a witch or not or whether or not she be the person who cast the
        original spell, or whether it be a man or any other creature.
              It may be asked what the Judge should do when such a person maintains that she
        removes spells by lawful and not unlawful means; and how the Judge can arrive at the truth
        of such a case. We answer that he should summon her and ask her what remedies she uses;
        but he must not rely only upon her word, for the ecclesiastical Judge whose duty it is must
        make diligent inquiry, either himself or by means of some parish priest who shall examine
        all his parishioners after placing them upon oath, as to what remedies she uses. And if, as is
        usually the case, they are found to be superstitious remedies, they must in no way be
        tolerated, on account of the terrible penalties laid down by the Canon Law, as will be shown.
              Again, it may be asked how the lawful remedies can be distinguished from the
        unlawful, since they always assert that they remove spells by certain prayers and the use of
        herbs. We answer that this will be easy, provided that a diligent inquiry be made. For
        although they must necessarily conceal their superstitious remedies, either that they may not
        be arrested, or that they may the more easily ensnare the minds of the simple, and therefore
       make great show of their use of prayers and herbs, yet they can be manifestly convicted by
       four superstitious actions as sorceresses and witches.
             For there are some who can divine secrets, and are able to tell things which they could
       only know through the revelation of evil spirits. For example: when the injured come to
       them to be healed, they can discover and make known the cause of their injury; and they can
       perfectly know this and tell it to those who consult them.
             Secondly, they sometimes undertake to cure the injury or spell of one person, but will
       have nothing to do with that of another. For in the Diocese of Spires there is a witch in a
       certain place called Zunhofen who, although she seems to heal many persons, confesses that
       she can in no way heal certain others; and this is for no other reason than, as the inhabitants
       of the place assert, that the spells case on such person have been so potently wrought by
       other witches with the help of devils that the devils themselves cannot remove them. For one
       devil cannot or will not always yield to another.
             Thirdly, it sometimes happens that they must make some reservation or exception in
       their cure of such injuries. Such a case is known to have occured in the town of Spires itself.
       And honest woman who had been bewitched in her shins sent for a diviner of this sort to
       come and heal her; and when the witch had entered her house and looked at her, she made
       such an exception. For she said: It there are no scales and hairs in the wound, I could take
       out all the other evil matter. And she revealed the cause of the injury, although she had come
       from the country from a distance of two miles, saying: You quarrelled with your neighbour
       on such a day, and therefore this had happened to you. Then, having extracted from the
       wound many other matters of various sorts, which were not scales or hairs, she restored her
       to health.
             Fourthly, they sometimes themselves observe, or cause to be observed, certain
       superstitious ceremonies. For instance, they fix some such time as before sunrise for people
       to visit them; or say that they cannot heal injuries which were caused beyond the limits of
       the estate on which they live, or that they can only heal two or three persons in a year. Yet
       they do not heal them, but only seem to do so by creasing to injure them.
             We could add many other considerations as touching the condition of such persons: as
       that, after the lapse of a certain time they have incurred the reputation of leading a bad and
       sinful life, or that they are adulteresses, or the survivors from covens of other witches.
       Therefore their gift of healing is not derived from God on account of the sanctity of their
       lives.
             Here we must refer incidentally to witch midwives, who surpass all other witches in
       their crimes, as we have shown in the First Part of this work. And the number of them is so
       great that, as has been found form their confessions, it is thought they there is scarcely any
       tiny hamlet in which at least one is not to be found. And that the magistrates may in some
       degree meet this danger, they should allow no midwife to practise without having been first
       sworn as a good Catholic; at the same time observing the other safeguards mentioned in the
       Second Part of this work.
             Here too we must consider archer-wizards, who constitute the graver danger to the
       Christian religion in that they have obtained protection on the estates of nobles and Princes
       who receive, patronize, and defend them. But that all such receivers and protectors are more
       damnable than all witches, especially in certain cases, is shown as follows. The Canonists
       and Theologians divide into two classes the patrons of such archer-wizards, according as
       they defend the error or the person. They who defend the error are more damnable than the
       wizards themselves, since they are judged to be not only heretics but heresiarchs (24, quest.
       3). And the laws do not make much special mention of such patrons, because they do not
       distinguish them from other heretics.
             But there are others who, while not excusing the sin, yet defend the sinner. These, for
       example, will do all in their power to protect such wizards (or other heretics) from trial and
       punishment at the hands of the Judge acting on behalf of the Faith.
             Similarly there are those in public authority, that is to say, public persons such as
       temporal Lords, and also spiritual Lords who have temporal jurisdiction, who are, either by
       omission or commission, patrons of such wizards and heretics.
             They are their patrons by omission when they neglect to perform their duty in regard to
       such wizards and suspects, or to their followers, receivers, defenders and patrons, when they
       are required by the Bishops or Inquisitors to do this: that is, by falling to arrest them, by not
       guarding them carefully when they are arrested, by not taking them to the place within their
       jurisdiction which has been appointed for them, by not promptly executing the sentence
       passed upon them, and by other such derelictions of their duty.
             They are their patrons by commission when, after such heretics have been arrested,
       they liberate them from prison without the licence or order of the Bishop or Judge; or when
       they directly or indirectly obstruct the trial, judgement, and sentence of such, or act in some
       similar way. The penalties for this have been declared in the Second Part of this work,
       where we treated of archer-wizards and other enchanters of weapons.
             It is enough now to say that all these are by law excommunicated, and incur the twelve
       great penalties. And if they continues obstinate in that excommunication for a year, they are
       then to be condemned as heretics.
             Who, then, are to be called receivers of such; and are they to be reckoned as heretics?
       All they, we answer, who receive such archer-wizards, enchanters of weapons,
       necromancers, or heretic witches as are the subject of this whole work. And such receivers
       are of two classes, as was the case with the defenders and patrons of such.
             For there are some who do not receive them only once or twice, but many times and
       often; and these are well called in Latin receptatores, from the frequentative form of the
       verb. And receivers of this class are sometimes blameless, since they act in ignorance and
       there is no sinister suspicion attaching to them. But sometimes they are to blame, as being
       well aware of the sins of those whom they receive; for the Church always denounces these
       wizards as the most cruel enemies of the faith. And if nevertheless temporal Lords receive,
       keep and defend them, etc., they are and are rightly called receivers of heretics. And with
       regard to such, the laws say that they are to be excommunicated.
             But others there are who do not often or many times receive such wizards or heretics,
       but only once or twice; and these are not properly called receptatores, but receptores, since
       they are not frequent receivers. (Yet the Arch-deacon disagrees with this view; but it is no
       great matter, for we are considering not words but deeds.)
             But there is this difference between receptatores and receptores: those temporal
       Princes are always receptatores who simply will not or cannot drive away such heretics. But
       receptores may be quite innocent.
             Finally, it is asked who are they who are said to be obstructors of the duty of
       Inquisitors and Bishops against such heretics; and whether they are to be reckoned as
       heretics. We answer that such obstructors are of two kinds. For there are some who cause a
       direct obstruction, by rashly on their own responsibility releasing from gaol those who have
       been detained on a charge of heresy, or by interfering with the process of the Inquisition by
       wreaking some injury to witnesses on behalf of the Faith because of the evidence they have
       given; or it may be that the temporal Lord issues an order that none but himself may try such
       a case, and that anyone charged with this crime should be brought before no one but
       himself, and that the evidence should be given only in his presence, or some similar order.
       And such, according to Giovanni d'Andrea, are direct obstructors. They who directly
       obstruct the process, judgement or sentence on behalf of the Faith, or help, advise or favour
       others in doing so, although they are guilty of a great sin, are not on that account to be
       judged heretics, unless it appears in other ways that they are obstinately and wilfully
       involved in such heresies of witches. But they are to be smitten with the sword of
       excommunication; and if they stubbornly endure that excommunication for a year, then are
       they to be condemned as heretics.
             But others are indirect obstructors. These, as Giovanni d'Andrea explains, are those
       who give such orders as that no one shall bear arms for the capture of heretics except the
       servants of the said temporal Lord. Such are less guilty than the former, and are not heretics;
       but they, and also any who advise, help or patronize them in such actions, are to be
       excommunicated; and if they obstinately remain in that excommunication for a year, they
       are then to be condemned as if they were heretics. And here it is to be understood that they
       are in such a way to be condemned as heretics that if they are willing to return, they are
       received back to mercy, having first abjured their error; but if not, they are to be handed
       over to the secular Court as impenitents.
             To sum up. Witch-midwives, like other witches, are to be condemned and sentences
       according to the nature of their crimes; and this is true also of those who, as we have said,
       remove spells of witchcraft superstitiously and by the help of devils; for it can hardly be
       doubted that, just as they are able to remove them, so can they inflict them. And it is a fact
       that some definite agreement is formed between witches and devils whereby some shall be
       able to hurt and others to heal, that so they may more easily ensnare the minds of the simple
       and recruit the ranks of their abandoned and hateful society. Archer-wizards and enchanters
       of weapons, who are only protected by being patronized, defended and received by temporal
       Lords, are subject to the same penalties; and they who patronize them, etc., or obstruct the
       officers of justice in their proceedings against them, are subject to all the penalties to which
       the patrons of heretics are liable, and are to be excommunicated. And if after they have
       obstinately endured that excommunication for a year they wish to repent, let them abjure
       that obstruction and patronage, and if not, they must be handed over as impenitents to the
       secular Court. And even if they have not endured their excommunication for a year, such
       obstructors can still be proceeded against as patrons of heretics.
             And all that has been said with regard to patrons, defenders, receivers, and obstructors
       in the case of archer-wizards, etc., applies equally in respect of all other witches who work
       various injuries to men, animals, and the fruits of the earth. But even the witches
       themselves, when in the court of conscience with humble and contrite spirit they weep for
       their sins and make clean confession asking forgiveness, are taken back to mercy. But when
       they are known, those whose duty it is must proceed against them, summoning, examining,
       and detaining them, and in all things proceeding in accordance with the nature of their
       crimes to a definitive and conclusive sentence, as has been shown, if they wish to avoid the
       snare of eternal damnation by reason of the excommunication pronounced upon them by the
       Church when they deliberately fail in their duty.

                                  THE
                          MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                                  PART III, QUESTION XXXV.
Finally, of the Method of Passing Sentence upon Witches who Enter or Cause to be Entered an Appeal,
                           whether such be Frivolous or Legitimate and Just.

            But if the Judge perceives that the accused is determined to have recourse to an appeal,
       he must first take note that such appeals are sometimes valid and legitimate, and sometimes
       entirely frivolous. Now it has already been explained that cases concerning the Faith are to
       be conducted in a simple and summary fashion, and therefore that no appeal is admitted in
       such cases. Nevertheless it sometimes happens that Judges, on account of the difficulty of
       the case, gladly prorogue and delay it; therefore they may consider that it would be just to
       allow an appeal when the accused feels that the Judge has really and actually acted towards
       him in a manner contrary to the law and justice; as that he has refused to allow him to
       defend himself, or that he has proceeded to a sentence against the accused on his own
       responsibility and without the counsel of others, or even without consent of the Bishop or
       his Vicar, when he might have taken into consideration much further evidence both for and
       against. For such reasons an appeal may be allowed, but not otherwise.
            Secondly, it is to be noted that, when notice of appeal has been given, the Judge should,
       without perturbation or disturbance, ask for a copy of the appeal, giving his promise that the
       matter shall not be delayed. And when the accused has given him a copy of the appeal, the
       Judge shall notify him that he has yet two days before he need answer it, and after those two
       days thirty more before he need prepare the apostils of the case. And although he may give
       his answer at once, and at once proceed to issue his apostils if he is very expert and
       experienced, yet it is better to act with caution, and fix a term of ten or twenty or twenty-five
       days, reserving to himself the right to prorogue the hearing of the appeal up to the legal limit
       of time.
            Thirdly, let the Judge take care that during the legal and appointed interval he must
       diligently examine and discuss the causes of the appeal and the alleged grounds of objection.
       And if after having taken good counsel he sees that he has unduly and unjustly proceeded
       against the accused, by refusing him permission to defend himself, or by exposing him to
       questions at an unsuitable time, or for any such reason; when the appointed time comes let
       him correct his mistake, carrying the process back to the point and stage where it was when
       the accused asked to be defended, or when he put a term to his examination, etc., and so
       remove the objection; and then let him proceed as we have said. For by the removal of the
       grounds for objection the appeal, which was legitimate, loses its weight.
            But here the circumspect and provident Judge will carefully take note that some
       grounds of objection or reparable; and they are such as we have just spoken of, and are to be
       dealt with in the above manner. But others are irreparable: as when the accused has actually
       and in fact been questioned, but has afterwards escaped and lodged an appeal; or that some
       box or vessel or such instruments as witches use has been seized and burned; or some other

       such irreparable and irrevocable action has been committed. In such a case the above
       procedure would not hold good, namely, taking the process back to the point where the
       objection arose.
             Fourthly, the Judge must note that, although thirty days may elapse between his
       receiving the appeal and his completing the apostils of the case, and he can assign to the
       petitioner the last day, that is, the thirtieth, for the hearing of his appeal; yet, that it may not
       seem that the wishes to molest the accused or some under suspicion of unduly harsh
       treatment of him, and that his behaviour may not seem to lend support to the objection
       which has caused the appeal, it is better that he should assign some day within the legal
       limit, such as the tenth or twentieth day, and he can afterwards, if he does not wish to be in a
       hurry, postpone it until the last legal day, saying that he is busy with other affairs.
             Fifthly, the Judge must take care that, when he affixes a term for the accused who is
       appealing and petitioning for apostils, he must provide not only for the giving, but both for
       the giving and receiving of apostils. For if he provided only for the giving of them, then the
       Judge against whom the appeal is lodged would have to discharge the appellant. Therefore
       let him assign to him a term, that is, such a day of such a year, for the giving and receiving
       from the Judge such apostils as he shall have decided to submit.
             Sixthly, he must take care that, in assigning this term, he shall not in his answer say
       that he will give either negative or affirmative apostils; but that he may have opportunity for
       fuller reflection, let him say that he will give such as he shall at the appointed time have
       decided upon.
             Let him also take care that in assigning this term to the appellant he give the appellant
       no opportunity to exercise any malicious precautions or cunning, and that he specify the
       place, day and hour. For example, let him assign the twentieth day of August, in the present
       year, at the hour of vespers, and the chamber of the Judge himself in such a house, in such a
       city, for the giving and receiving of apostils such as shall have been decided upon for such
       appellant.
             Seventhly, let him note that, if he has decided in his mind that the charge against the
       accused justly requires that he should be detained, in assigning the term he must set it down
       that he assigns that term for the giving or receiving of apostils by the appellant in person,
       and that he assigns to the said appellant such a place for giving to him and receiving from
       him apostils; and then it will be fully in the power of the Judge to detain the appellant,
       granted that he has first given negative apostils; but otherwise it will not be so.
             Eighthly, let the Judge take care not to take any further action in respect of the
       appellant, such as arresting him, or questioning him, or liberating him from prison, from the
       time when the appeal is presented to him up to the time when he has returned negative
       apostils.
             To sum up. Note that it often happens that, when the accused is in doubt as to what sort
       of sentence he will receive, since he is conscious of his guilt, he frequently takes refuge in
       an appeal, that so he may escape the Judge's sentence. Therefore he appeals from that Judge,
       advancing some frivolous reason, as that the Judge held him in custody without allowing
       him the customary surety; or in some such way he may colour his frivolous appeal. In this
       case the Judge shall ask for a copy of the appeal; and having received it he shall either at
       once or after two days give his answer and assign to the appellant for the giving and
       receiving of such apostils as shall have been decided upon a certain day, hour, and place,
       within the legal limit, as, for instance, the 25th, 26th or 30th day of such a month. And
       during the assigned interval the Judge shall diligently examine the copy of the appeal, and
       the reasons or objections upon which it is based, and shall consult with learned lawyers
       whether he shall submit negative apostils, that is, negative answers, and thereby disallow the
       appeal, or whether he shall allow the appeal and submit affirmative and fitting apostils to the
       Judge to whom the appeal is made.
              But if he sees that the reasons for the appeal are frivolous and worthless, and that the
       appellant only wishes to escape or to postpone his sentence, let his apostils be negative and
       refutatory. If, however, he sees that the objections are true and just, and not irreparable; or if
       he is in doubt whether the accused is maliciously causing him trouble, and wishes to clear
       himself of all suspicion, let him grant the appellant affirmative and fitting apostils. And
       when the appointed time for the appellant has arrived, if the Judge has not prepared his
       apostils or answers, or in some other way is not ready, the appellant can at once demand that
       his appeal be heard, and may continue to do so on each successive day up to the thirtieth,
       which is the last day legally allowed for the submission of the apostils.
              But if he has prepared them and is ready, he can at once give his apostils to the
       appellant. If, then, he has decided to give negative or refutatory apostils, he shall, at the
       expiration of the appointed time, submit them in the following manner:
              AND the said Judge, answering to the said appeal, if it may be called an appeal, says
       that he, the Judge, has proceeded and did intend to proceed in accordance with the
       Canonical decrees and the Imperial statutes and laws, and has not departed from the path of
       either law nor intended so to depart, and has in no way acted or intended to act unjustly
       towards the appellant, as is manifest from an examination of the alleged grounds for this
       appeal. For he has not acted unjustly towards him by detaining him and keeping him in
       custody; for he was accused of such heresy, and there was such evidence against him that he
       was worthily convicted of heresy, or was strongly suspected, and as such it was and is just
       that he should be kept in custody: neither has he acted unjustly by refusing him sureties; for
       the crime of heresy is one of the more serious crimes, and the appellant had been convicted
       but persisted in denying the charge, and therefore not even the very best sureties were
       admissable, but he is and was to be detained in prison. And so he shall proceed with the
       other objections.
              Having done this, let him say as follows: Wherefore it is apparant that the Judge has
       duly and justly proceeded, and has not deviated from the path of justice, and has in no way
       unduly molested the appellant; but the appellant, advancing pretended and false objections,
       has by an undue and unjust appeal attempted to escape his sentence. Wherefore his appeal is
       frivolous and worthless, having no foundation, and erring in matter and form. And since the
       laws do not recognize frivolous appeals, nor are they to be recognized by the Judge,
       therefore the Judge has himself said that he does not admit and does not intend to admit the
       said appeal, nor does he recognize nor yet propose to recognize it. And he gives this answer
       to the said accused who make this undue appeal in the form of negative apostils, and
       commands that they be given to him immediately after the said appeal. And so he shall give
       it to the Notary who has presented the appeal to him.
              And when these negative apostils have been given to the appellant, the Judge shall at
       once proceed with his duty, ordering the accused to be seized and detained, or assigning to
       him a day to appear before him, as shall seem best to him. For he does not cease to be the
       Judge, but shall continue his process against the appellant until the Judge to whom the
       appeal was made shall order him to cease.
             But let the Judge take care not to commence any new proceedings against the appellant,
       by arresting him or, if he is in custody, liberating him from prison, from the time of the
       presentation of the appeal up to the time of the return of negative apostils to him. But after
       that time, as we have said, he can do so if justice requires it, until he is prevented by the
       Judge to whom the appeal has been made. Then, with the process sealed under cover, and
       with a sure and safe escort and if necessary a suitable surety, let him send him to the said
       Judge.
             But if the Judge has decided to return affirmative and fitting apostils, let him submit
       them in writing in the following manner on the arrival of the day appointed for the giving
       and receiving of apostils:
             AND the said Judge, answering to the said appeal, if it may be called an appeal, if it
       may be called an appeal, says that he has proceeded in the present cause justly and as he
       ought and not otherwise, nor has he molested or intended to molest the appellant, as is
       apparent from a perusal of the alleged objections. For he has not molested him by, etc. (Here
       he shall answer to each of the objections in the appeal, in the best and most truthful manner
       that he can.)
             Wherefore it is apparent that the said Judge has in no way dealt unjustly by the
       appellant nor given him cause to appeal, but that the appellant is afraid lest justice should
       proceed against him according to his crimes. And therefore the appeal is frivolous and
       worthless, having no foundation, and not being admissable by the laws or the Judge. But in
       reverence for the Apostolic See, to which the appeal is made, the said Judge says that he
       admits the appeal an intends to recognize it, deferring the whole matter to out Most Holy
       Lord the Pope, and leaving it to the Holy Apostolic See: assigning to the said appellant a
       certain time, namely, so many months now following, within which, with the process sealed
       under cover given to him by the said Judge, or having given suitable sureties to present
       himself at the Court of Rome, or under a sure and safe escort appointed to him by the said
       Judge, he must present himself in the Court of Rome before our Lord the Pope. And this
       answer the said Judge gives tot he said appellant as affirmative apostils, and orders that it be
       given to him immediately after the appeal presented to him. And so he shall hand it to the
       Notary who has presented the appeal to him.
             The prudent Judge must here take note that, as soon as he has given these fitting
       apostils to the appellant, he at once ceases to be the Judge in that cause from which the
       appeal was made, and can proceed no further in it, unless it be referred back to him by our
       Most Holy Lord the Pope. Therefore let him have no more to do with that case, except to
       send the said appellant in the above manner to out Lord the Pope, assign to him a convenient
       time, say one, two or three months, within which he must prepare and make himself ready to
       appear and present himself at the Court of Rome, giving a suitable surety; or, if he cannot do
       this, let him be sent under a sure and safe escort. For he must either bind himself by the best
       means in his power to present himself within the assigned time before our Lord the Pope in
       the Court of Rome, or his appeal must necessarily fall to the ground.
             But if the Judge has another case, and proceeds against the accused in another case in
       which he has not lodged any appeal: in that other case he remains, as before, Judge. And
       even if, after the appeal has been admitted, and the affirmative apostils have been given, the
       appellant is accused and denounced to the Judge in respect of other heresies which were not
       in question in the case from which he appealed, he does not cease to be the Judge, and can
       proceed with the inquiry and the examination of witnesses as before. And when the first
       case has been finished in the Court of Rome, or after reference back to the Judge, he is free
       to proceed with the second.
            Let Judges also take care that they send the process to the Court of Rome, sealed and
       under cover, to the Judges appointed to execute justice, together with a digest of the merits
       of the process. And Inquisitors should not concern themselves to appear at Rome against the
       appellants; but should leave them to their own Judges, who, if the Inquisitors are unwilling
       to appear against the appellants, shall provide their own advocates for the appellant, if they
       wish to expedite the case.
            Let Judges also take note that, if they are personally summoned by the appellant, and
       appear, they must beware at all costs against engaging in litigation, but must leave the whole
       process and cause to those Judges, and so manage that they may be able to return as soon as
       possible; so that they may not be sorely troubled with fatigues, misery, labour, and expense
       in Rome. For by this means much damage is caused to the Church, and heretics are greatly
       encouraged; and thereafter Judges will not receive so much respect and reverence, not will
       they be so much feared as before. Also other heretics, seeing the Judges fatigued and
       detained in the Court of Rome, will exalt their horns, and despise and malign them, and
       more boldly proclaim their heresies; and when they are accused, they will appeal in the
       same way. Other Judges, also, will have their authority weakened when they proceed on
       behalf of the Faith and are zealous in extirpating heretics, since they will fear lest they may
       be troubled with miseries and fatigues arising from similar appeals. All this is most
       prejudicial to the Faith of the Holy Church of God; wherefore may the Spouse of that
       Church in mercy preserve her from all such injuries.

                                        TRANSCRIPTION INCOMPLETE


       T        HE official Document of Approbation of the treatise Malleus Maleficarum, and the
                subscription of the Doctors of the most honourable University of Cologne, duly set forth and
                recorded as a public documents and deposition.


       I   N the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. Know all men by these presents, whosoever shall
           read, see or hear the tenor of this official and public document, that in the year of our Lord,
           1487, upon a Saturday, being the nineteenth day of the month of May, at the fifth hour after
       noon, or thereabouts, in the third year of the Pontificate of our most Holy Father and Lord, the lord
       Innocent, by divine providence Pope, the eighth of that name, in the very and actual presence of
       me Arnold Kolich, public notary, and in the presence of the witnesses whose names are hereunder
       written and who were convened and especially summoned for this purpose, the Venerable and
       Very Reverend Father Henry Kramer, Professor of Sacred Theology, of the Order of Preachers,
       Inquisitor of heretical depravity, directly delegated thereto by the Holy See together with the
       Venerable and Very Reverend Father James Sprenger, Professor of Sacred Theology and Prior of
       the Dominican Convent at Cologne, being especially appointed as colleague of the said Father
       Henry Kramer, hath on behalf both of himself and his said colleague made known unto us and
       declared that the Supreme Pontiff now happily reigning, lord Innocent, Pope, as hath been set out
       above, hath committed and granted by a bull duly signed and sealed unto the aforesaid Inquisitors
       Henry and James, members of the Order of Preachers and Professors of Sacred Theology, by His
       Supreme Apostolic Authority, the power of making search and inquiry into all heresies, and most
       especially into the heresy of witches, an abomination that thrives and waxes strong in these our
       unhappy days, and he has bidden them diligently to perform this duty throughout the five
       Archdioceses of the five Metropolitan Churches, that is to say, Mainz, Cologne, Trèves, Salzburg
       and Bremen, granting them every faculty of judging and proceeding against such even with the
       power of putting malefactors to death, according to the tenor of the Apostolic bull, which they
       hold and possess and have exhibited unto us, a document which is whole, entire, untouched, and in
       no way lacerated or impaired, in fine whose integrity is above any suspicion. And the tenor of the
       said bull commences thus: “Innocent, Bishop, Servant of the servants of God, for an eternal
       remembrance. Desiring with the most heartfelt anxiety, even as Our Apostleship requires, that the
       Catholic Faith should be especially in this Our day increase and flourish everywhere, . . .” and it
        concludes thus: “Given at Rome, at S. Peter's, on the 9 December of the Year of the Incarnation of
        Our Lord one thousand, four hundred and eighty-four, in the first Year of Our Pontificate.”

                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                    INTRODUCTION TO ONLINE EDITION
          ●   Editing Parameters                   It was never my intention when setting out to
         ● A Note on References               transcribe the Malleus Maleficarum to write an
                                              introduction to the online edition. My intention was to
         ● Deleted Links
                                              simply transcribe the Malleus in its entirety, along with
         ● Transcription vs. Scanning both the original 1928 introduction and the subsequent

                                              1948 introduction (both written by the Rev. Montague
       Summers), along with the various ancillary material within the edition in my possession. But
       upon transcribing these introductions, I discovered that neither of them were very balanced
       or impartial. This could be expected, as the good Rev. Summers was, I believe, a Catholic
       priest and theologian. He was also apparently a member of the Dominican Order, the same
       order from which Henry Kramer and James Sprenger, the authors of the Malleus
       Maleficarum, were drawn. As such, Summers' point of view may not be exactly impartial, as
       is evidenced by the first line of his 1928 introduction:
             “It has been recognized even from the very earliest of times, during the first gropings
       towards the essential conveniences of social decency and social order, that witchcraft is an
       evil thing, an enemy to light, an ally of the powers of darkness, disruption, and decay.”
             As Rev. Summers translated the Malleus Maleficarum into English, and wrote the
       Introductions, Biblography, and Notes of the edition which I have transcribed for online
       publication, one can understand his natural affinity for the work and, being Christian
       himself, he may be excused for being predisposed to certain prejudices. However
       understanding modern readers may be of Rev. Summers' prejudices, one cannot ignore the
       fact that both of his introductions to the Malleus seem more intent on validating the content
       of the work as an expression of contemporary religious truth rather than a work born of
       Medieval superstition. Indeed, one often expects the good Reverend to wax poetic about the
       good old days of the Inquisition, and times when those horrid witches really got what they
       deserved. There is left no doubt in the reader's mind that Rev. Summers not only believed in
       the existence of witches as the Medieval Church perceived them, but felt that the
       Inquisition, and the Malleus, were both justified and necessary. In both of his introductions
       (especially the original 1928 introduction), he seems more intent on using the occasion to
       convince us that the murder of thousands of innocent people, for the crime of witchcraft,
       during the Inquisition was somehow noble, and that the authors of the Malleus, Heinrich
       Kramer and James Sprenger, were visionaries of their time. One often finds the text of the
       introductions reading as if it had been written 500 years previously when the Malleus was
       originally published and the Inquisition was in full swing.
             I therefore felt it necessary to provide an alternate (and hopefully somewhat more

       balanced and objective) introduction. I will not discuss the relative merits of the Malleus,
       nor theorize as to whether or not the opinions and techniques discussed therein are valid. My
       interest in the work concerns its historical significance, in that whatever our opinions now,
       as the Dover Edition which I have transcribed expresses: “Even if you do not believe in
       witchcraft, the world of 1484 did.”
             It is with that in mind that I hope to approach and examine in this introduction the
       history of the Malleus Maleficarum, as well as its social impact upon its time (as well as on
       our time). And it is my hope that I may be somewhat more concise in my presentation than
       Rev. Summers. With that in mind, I will make every attempt to keep my own prejudices
       firmly in check.
              - Wicasta Lovelace
             The date of the first edition of the Malleus Maleficarum cannot be determined with any
       real authority. It is, however, largely agreed that the most likely date of publication was in
       the year 1486. There were fourteen editions between 1487 and 1520, and at least sixteen
       editions between 1574 and 1669. There are modern translations as well: Der Hexenhammer,
       J.W.R. Schmidt, 1906, and an English translation (with introduction) by Montague
       Summers, published in 1928 and reprinted in 1948. The online edition of the Malleus is, of
       course, drawn from this latter edition. My copy is a reprint of this edition, which was first
       published in 1971 by Dover Publications and which is still in print today.
             When the Malleus was submitted to the University of Cologne by
       the authors on May 9th, 1487, it was officially approved by all of the
       Doctors of the Theological faculty. Due to the especial weight given to
       the book by the Bull of Pope Innocent VIII (given to Heinrich and
       Sprenger two years previously, authorizing them to continue the
       Inquisition in the Alps. It allegedly was included with the text of the
       Malleus to make it appear that the whole book enjoyed papal sanction)
       and the Official Letter of Approbation by the Faculty of Theology of the
       University of Cologne, the Malleus was immediately accepted as a work
                                                                                          View Cover
       of importance. There is no doubt that it had, in its day, and for a couple
       of centuries afterwards, an enormous influence on contemporary society. It was continually
       quoted and appealed to in the witch-trials of Germany, France, Italy, and England. It
       remained in such use for over three hundred years.
             In the Malleus Maleficarum, contemporary cases illustrate methods by which witches
       attempt to control and subvert the world: How and why women roast their first-born male
       child; the confession of how to raise a tempest by a washwoman suspended “hardly clear of
       the ground” by her thumbs; methods of making a formal pact with the Devil; how witches
       deprive men of their “vital member”; and many others. Methods of destroying and curing
       witchcraft, such as remedies against incubus and succubus devils.
             Formal rules for initiating a process of justice were set down: how it should be
       conducted and the method of pronouncing sentence; when to use the trial by red-hot iron
       and other methods of torture for extracting confessions; how the body was to be shaved and
       searched for tokens and amulets of the Devil, including those sewn under the skin (often a
       birthmark, or a mole, or even freckles, were seen as a mark of Satan; indeed, nearly any
       blemish upon the skin could be interpreted as proof of a pact made with the Devil).
             As Rev. Montague Summers said in his 1928 introduction, the Malleus was the
       casebook on every magistrate's desk, and remained so, literally, for centuries. For that alone
       it has earned its dubious place in history, and should not be forgotten.
             This famous document should interest the historian, the student of witchcraft and the
       occult, and the psychologist who is interested in the medieval mind as it was confronted
       with various forces which could only be explained as witchcraft. With the rise of the
       Religious Right in America, and the ever-increasing intolerance of minority religions by
       radical Christians, the lessons contained in the Malleus Maleficarum are lessons which none
       of us can afford to forget. Because of the misconceptions and fears heaped upon minority
       religions by the Inquisition, which was fueled in part by the contents of the Malleus and the
       treatises set forth within it, the Malleus Maleficarum is as contemporary today as it was in
       its own time. We must remember those who suffered because of it. And perhaps, by our
       awareness, we can make certain that history does not repeat itself.

             The full text of the Malleus Maleficarum as translated by Rev. Montague Summers has
       been preserved in this online edition. While there may have been occasional mis-types made
       during the transcription of the text, there are many instances where words are simply spelled
       differently than that which the modern reader is used to. An example of this is the spelling
       of pharoah as pharao, and the frequent spelling of fulfill as fulfil. There are man other
       examples of this sort within the text of the Malleus, and most of these will be evident by
       their frequent use.
             I have decided against editing these differences in spelling and diction, hoping instead
       to preserve the integrity of Rev. Summer's translation verbatum. I am confident that the
       modern reader can overlook these minor differences with little effort.

                                              A NOTE ON REFERENCES
            The reader will, no doubt, notice many strange references in the text of the Malleus
       Maleficarum. Many are simply references to the works of other scholars, such as Aristotle,
       St. Augustine, S. Thomas, etc. But on many occasions references are made to books of The
       Bible which may seem strange to most modern readers (at least to non-Catholic Christian
       denominations). Those readers whose familiarity with The Bible comes from the King
       James Version may be surprised by the references to these “obscure” books of The Bible,
       such as Paralipomenon, Apocalypse, Judith, and Tobias. These books were originally a part
       of The Bible, but were cut from the King James version as it was developed. They exist
       today primarily as a part of the Douay Rheims Version of The Bible, which is widely used
       by Catholics.
            An online version of the Douay Rheims Bible exists at;
              http://davinci.marc.gatech.edu/catholic/scriptures/douay.htm

            The second phase of the online implementation of the Malleus Maleficarum will see
       links installed to all references made within the Malleus where online counterparts exist.
       This phase of the online Malleus will be implemented when the transcription of the text is
       complete. It will also incorporate many of those references directly from this web site.

                                                      DELETED LINKS
             Many long-time participants in this project will no doubt notice that the reference links
       have been removed, except for those to the notes of Rev. Summers which were a part of the
       version of the Malleus Maleficarum which is being transcribed. I had originally attempted to
       link all of the references made in the text to online editions where possible. However, this
       proved to be incredibly time consuming, both in coding the HTML links and in locating
       online editions. And for this reason the effort was abandoned.
             The primary focus concerning the transcription of the Malleus Maleficarum is now the
       text itself. It seems most important, given the interest generated by this project, that the text
       be posted as quickly as possible. Eliminating the links to the references, and the subsequent
       effort that entails, has allowed the transcribing of the text to proceed at a greatly accelerated
       pace. As such, the full text of the Malleus will be posted within a few months.
             The links to the references will still be installed, but subsequent to the complete
       transcription and posting of the text.

                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                   INTRODUCTION TO ONLINE EDITION
                                         TRANSCRIPTION vs. SCANNING
              Many participants in this project have questioned my determination to transcribe the
       text of the Malleus Maleficarum by hand, as opposed to scanning the pages and using
       Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software to generate the text. While it is certain that
       the latter would prove more expedient and see the online edition posted much sooner,
       transcribing the text, while more labor intensive, ensures a more accurate translation to
       HTML format. While I understand that transcribing the text means it will take longer to post
       it, I believe that the more reliable translation is more than worth the additional effort.
              I apologize to anyone who is inconvenienced by this approach (those college students
       who wish to use the text of the Malleus as part of their thesis come to mind). However, I
       believe that the importance of the Malleus Maleficarum to modern readers, especially in a
       time when the rhetoric of the Religious Right grows stronger day by day (rhetoric which
       regards the occult, witchcraft, and even homosexuality, with an intolerance reminiscent of
       the Inquisition), overshadows any temporary inconvenience. I want this online edition to be
       as accurate a translation as possible, with mistakes and misprints limited to a minimum.
              In an age in which the Malleus Maleficarum could again achieve a relevance in the
       hands of radical Christian leaders, the accuracy of this online translation is, I believe,
       all-important.

                            MALLEUS MALEFICARUM

                               THE BULL OF INNOCENT VIII
 Innocent, Bishop, Servant of the servants of God, for an eternal remembrance.
             Desiring with the most hearfelt anxiety, even as Our Apostleship requires, that the Catholic
       faith should especially in this Our day increase and flourish everywhere, and that all heretical
       depravity should be driven far from the frontiers and bournes of the Faithful, We very gladly
       proclaim and even restate those particular means and methods whereby Our pious desire may
       obtain its wished effect, since when all errors are uprooted by Our diligent avocation as by the hoe
       of a provident husbandman, a zeal for, and the regular observance of, Our holy Faith will be all the
       more strongly impressed upon the hearts of the faithful.
             It has indeed lately come to Our ears, not without afflicting Us with bitter sorrow, that in
       some parts of Northern Germany, as well as in the provinces, townships, territories, districts, and
       dioceses of Mainz, Cologne, Tréves, Salzburg, and Bremen, many persons of both sexes,
       unmindful of their own salvation and straying from the Catholic Faith, have abandoned themselves
       to devils, incubi and succubi, and by their incantations, spells, conjurations, and other accursed
       charms and crafts, enormities and horrid offences, have slain infants yet in the mother's womb, as
       also the offspring of cattle, have blasted the produce of the earth, the grapes of the vine, the fruits
       of the trees, nay, men and women, beasts of burthen, herd-beasts, as well as animals of other kinds,
       vineyards, orchards, meadows, pasture-land, corn, wheat, and all other cereals; these wretches
       furthermore afflict and torment men and women, beasts of burthen, herd-beasts, as well as animals
       of other kinds, with terrible and piteous pains and sore diseases, both internal and external; they
       hinder men from performing the sexual act and women from conceiving, whence husbands cannot
       know their wives nor wives receive their husbands; over and above this, they blasphemously
       renounce that Faith which is theirs by the Sacrament of Baptism, and at the instigation of the
       Enemy of Mankind they do not shrink from committing and perpetrating the foulest abominations
       and filthiest excesses to the deadly peril of their own souls, whereby they outrage the Divine
       Majesty and are a cause of scandal and danger to very many. And although Our dear sons Henry
       Kramer and James Sprenger, Professors of Theology, of the Order of Friars Preachers, have been
       by Letters Apostolic delegated as Inquisitors of these heretical pravities, and still are Inquisitors,
       the first in the aforesaid parts of Northern Germany, wherein are included those aforesaid
       townships, districts, dioceses, and other specified localities, and the second in certain territories
       which lie along the borders of the Rhine, nevertheless not a few clerics and lay folk of those
       countries, seeking too curiously to know more than concerns them, since in the aforesaid
       delegatory letters there is no express and specific mention by name of these provinces, townships,
       dioceses, and districts, and further since the two delegates themselves and the abominations they
       are to encounter are not designated in detailed and particular fashion, these persons are not
       ashamed to contend with the most unblushing effrontery that these enormities are not practised in
       these provinces, and consequently the aforesaid Inquisitors have no legal right to exercise their
       powers of inquisition in the provinces, townships, dioceses, districts, and territories, which have
       been rehearsed, and that the Inquisitors may not proceed to punish, imprison, and penalize
       criminals convicted of the heinous offences and many wickednesses which have been set forth.
       Accordingly in the aforesaid provinces, townships, dioceses, and districts, the abominations and
       enormities in question remain unpunished not without open danger to the souls of many and peril
       of eternal damnation.
              Wherefore We, as is Our duty, being wholly desirous of removing all hindrances and
       obstacles by which the good work of the Inquisitors may be let and tarded, as also of applying
       potent remedies to prevent the disease of heresy and other turpitudes diffusing their poison to the
       destruction of many innocent souls, since Our zeal for the Faith especially incites us, lest that the
       provinces, townships, dioceses, districts, and territories of Germany, which We had specified, be
       deprived of the benefits of the Holy Office thereto assigned, by the tenor of these presents in virtue
       of Our Apostolic authority We decree and enjoin that the aforesaid Inquisitors be empowered to
       proceed to the just correction, imprisonment, and punishment of any persons, without let or
       hindrance, in every way as if the provinces, townships, dioceses, districts, territories, yea, even the
       persons and their crimes in this kind were named and particularly designated in Our letters.
       Moreover, for greater surety We extend these letters deputing this authority to cover all the
       aforesaid provinces, townships, dioceses, districts, territories, persons, and crimes newly
       rehearsed, and We grant permission to the aforesaid Inquisitors, to one separately or to both, as
       also to Our dear son John Gremper, priest of the diocese of Constance, Master of Arts, their
       notary, or to any other public notary, who shall be by them, or by one of them, temporarily
       delegated to those provinces, townships, dioceses, districts, and aforesaid territories, to proceed,
       according to the regulations of the Inquisition, against any persons of whatsoever rank and high
       estate, correcting, mulcting, imprisoning, punishing, as their crimes merit, those whom they have
       found guilty, the penalty being adapted to the offence. Moreover, they shall enjoy a full and
       perfect faculty of expounding and preaching the word of God to the faithful, so often as
       opportunity may offer and it may seem good to them, in each and every parish church of the said
       provinces, and they shall freely and lawfully perform any rites or execute any business which may
       appear advisable in the aforesaid cases. By Our supreme authority We grant them anew full and
       complete faculties.
              At the same time by Letters Apostolic We require Our venerable Brother, the Bishop of
       Strasburg (Albrecht von Bayern, 1478-1506 - ed.), that he himself shall announce, or by some
       other or others cause to be announced, the burthen if Our Bull, which he shall solemnly publish
       when and so often as he deems it necessary, or when he shall be requested so to do by the
       Inquisitors or by one of them. Nor shall he suffer them in disobedience to the tenor of these
       presents to be molested or hindered by any authority whatsoever, but he shall threaten all who
       endeavour to hinder or harass the Inquisitors, all who oppose them, all rebels, of whatsoever rank,
       estate, position, pre-eminence, dignity, or any condition they may be, or whatsoever privilege or
       exemption they may claim, with excommunication, suspension, interdict, and yet more terrible
       penalties, censures, and punishment, as may seem good to him, and that without any right of
       appeal, and if he will he may by Our authority aggravate and renew these penalties as often as he
       list, calling in, if so please him, the help of the secular arm.
              Non obstantibus . . . Let no man therefore . . . But if any dare to do so, which God forbid, let
       him know that upon him will fall the wrath of Almighty God, and of the Blessed Apostles Peter
       and Paul.

            Given at Rome, at S. Peter's, on the 9 December of the Year of the Incarnation of Our Lord
       one thousand four hundred and eighty-four, in the first year of Our Pontificate.

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM

                         INTRODUCTION TO 1948 EDITION
             It has been observed that “it is quite impossible to appreciate and understand the true and
       inner lives of men and women in Elizabethan and Stuart England, in the France of Louis XIII and
       during the long reign of his son and successor, in Italy of the Renaissance and the Catholic
       Reaction - to name but three European countries and a few definite periods - unless we have some
       realization of the part that Witchcraft played in those ages amid the affairs of these Kingdoms. All
       classes were affected and concerned from Pope to peasant, from Queen to cottage girl.”
             Witchcraft was inextricably mixed with politics. Matthew Paris tells us how in 1232 the Chief
       Justice Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent, (Shakespeare's “gentle Hubert” in King John), was accused
       by Peter do Roches, Bishop of Winchester, of having won the favour of Henry III through “charms
       and incantations”. In 1324 there was a terrific scandal at Coventry when it was discovered that a
       number of the richest and most influential burghers of the town had long been consulting with
       Master John, a professional necromancer, and paying him large sums to bring about by his arts the
       death of Edward II and several nobles of the court. Alice Perrers, the mistress pf Edward III, was
       not only reputed to have infatuated the old King by occult spells, but her physician (believed to be
       a mighty sorcerer) was arrested on a charge of confecting love philtres and talismans. Henry V, in
       the autumn of 1419, prosecuted his stepmother, Joan of Navarre, for attempting to kill him by
       witchcraft, “in the most horrible manner that one could devise.” The conqueror of Agincourt was
       exceedingly worried about the whole wretched business, as also was the Archbishop of
       Canterbury, who ordered public prayers for the King's safety. In the reign of his son, Henry VI, in
       1441, one of the highest and noblest ladies in the realm, Eleanor Cobham, Duchess of Gloucester,
       was arraigned for conspiring with “a clerk”, Roger Bolingbroke, “a most notorious evoker of
       demons”, and “the most famous scholar in the whole world in astrology in magic”, to procure the
       death of the young monarch by sorcery, so that the Duke of Gloucester, Henry's uncle and
       guardian, might succeed to the crown. In this plot were further involved Canon Thomas Southwell,
       and a “relapsed witch”, that is to say, one who had previously (eleven years before) been
       incarcerated upon grave suspicion of black magic, Margery Jourdemayne. Bolingbroke, whose
       confession implicated the Duchess, was hanged; Canon Southwell died in prison; the witch in
       Smithfield was “burn'd to Ashes”, since her offence was high treason. The Duchess was sentenced
       to a most degrading public penance, and imprisoned for life in Peel Castle, Isle of Man. Richard
       III, upon seizing the throne in 1483, declared that the marriage of his brother, Edward IV, with the
       Lady Elizabeth Grey, had been brought about by “sorcery and witchcraft”, and further that
       “Edward's wife, that monstrous witch, has plotted with Jane Shore to waste and wither his body.”
       Poor Jane Shore did most exemplary penance, walking the flinty streets of London barefoot in her
       kirtle. In the same year when Richard wanted to get rid of the Duke of Buckingham, his former
       ally, one of the chief accusations he launched was that the Duke consulted with a Cambridge
       “necromancer” to compass and devise his death.
             One of the most serious and frightening events in the life of James VII of Scotland
       (afterwards James I of England) was the great conspiracy of 1590, organized by the Earl of
       Bothwell. James with good reason feared and hated Bothwell, who, events amply proved, was
       Grand Master of more than one hundred witches, all adepts in poisoning, and all eager to do away
       with the King. In other words, Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell, was the centre and head of a vast
       political plot. A widespread popular panic was the result of the discovery of this murderous
       conspiracy.
             In France as early as 583, when the infant son and heir of King Chilperic, died of dysentery,
       as the doctors diagnosed it, it came to light that Mumolus, one of the leading officials of the court,
       had been secretly administering to the child medicines, which he obtained from “certain witches of
       Paris”. These potions were pronounced by the physicians to be strong poisons. In 1308, Guichard,
       Bishop of Troyes, was accused of having slain by sorcery the Queen of Philip IV of France
       (1285-1314), Jeanne of Navarre, who died three years before. The trial dragged on from 1308 to
       1313, and many witnesses attested on oath that the prelate had continually visited certain notorious
       witches, who supplied him philtres and draughts. In 1315, during the brief reign (1314-1316) of
       Louis X, the eldest son of Philip IV, was hanged Enguerrand de Marigny, chamberlain, privy
       councillor, and chief favourite of Philip, whom, it was alleged, he had bewitched to gain the royal
       favour. The fact, however, which sealed his doom was his consultation with one Jacobus de Lor, a
       warlock, who was to furnish a nostrum warranted to put a very short term to the life of King Louis.
       Jacobus strangled himself in prison.
             In 1317 Hugues Géraud, Bishop of Cahors, was executed by Pope John XXII, who reigned
       1316-1334, residing at Avignon. Langlois says that the Bishop had attempted the Pontiff's life by
       poison procured from witches.
             Perhaps the most resounding of all scandals of this kind in France was the La Voison case,
       1679-1682, when it was discovered that Madame de Montespan had for years been trafficking with
       a gang of poisoners and sorcerers, who plotted the death of the Queen and the Dauphan, so that
       Louis XIV might be free to wed Athénais de Montespan, whose children should inherit the throne.
       The Duchesse de Fontanges, a beautiful young country girl, who had for a while attracted the
       wayward fancy of Louis, they poisoned out of hand. Money was poured out like water, and it has
       been said that “the entire floodtide of poison, witchcraft and diabolism was unloosed” to attain the
       ends of that “marvellous beauty” (so Mme. de Sévigné calls her), the haughty and reckless
       Marquise de Montespan. In her thwarted fury she well nigh resolved to sacrifice Louis himself to
       her overweening ambition and her boundless pride. The highest names in France - the Princesse de
       Tingry, the Duchesse de Vitry, the Duchesse de Lusignan, the Duchesse de Bouillon, the Comtesse
       de Soissons, the Duc de Luxembourg, the Marguis de Cessac - scores of the older aristocracy,
       were involved, whilst literally hundreds of venal apothecaries, druggists, pseudo-alchemists,
       astrologers, quacks, warlocks, magicians, charlatans, who revolved round the ominous and terrible
       figure of Catherine La Voisin, professional seeress, fortune-teller, herbalist, beauty-specialist, were
       caught in the meshes of law. No less than eleven volumes of François Ravaison's huge work,
       Archives de la Bastille, are occupied with this evil crew and their doings, their sorceries and their
       poisonings.
             During the reign of Urban VIII, Maffeo Barberini, 1623-1644, there was a resounding scandal
       at Rome when it was discovered that “after many invocations of demons” Giacinto Contini,
       nephew of the Cardinal d'Ascoli, had been plotting with various accomplices to put an end to the
       Pope's life, and thus make way for the succession of his uncle to the Chair of Peter. Tommaso
       Orsolini of Recanate, moreover, after consulting with certain scryers and planetarians, readers of
       the stars, was endeavouring to bribe the apothecary Carcurasio of Naples to furnish him with a
       quick poison, which might be mingled with the tonics and electuaries prescribed for the ailing
       Pontiff, (Ranke, History of the Popes, ed. 1901, Vol. III, pp. 375-6).
            To sum up, as is well observed by Professor Kittredge, who more than once emphasized “I
       have no belief in the black art or in the interference of demons in the daily life of mortals”, it
       makes no difference whether any of the charges were true or whether the whole affairs were
       hideous political chicanery. “Anyhow, it reveals the beliefs and the practices of the age.”
            Throughout the centuries witchcraft was universally held to be a dark and horrible reality; it
       was an ever-present, fearfully ominous menace, a thing most active, most perilous, most powerful
       and true. Some may consider these mysteries and cantrips and invocations, these sabbats and
       rendezvous, to have been merest mummery and pantomime, but there is no question that the
       psychological effect was incalculable, and harmful in the highest degree. It was, to use a modern
       phrase, “a war of nerves”. Jean Bodin, the famous juris-consult (1530-90) whom Montaigne
       acclaims to be the highest literary genius of his time, and who, as a leading member of the
       Parlement de Paris, presided over important trials, gives it as his opinion that there existed, no only
       in France, a complete organization of witches, immensely wealthy, of almost infinite potentialities,
       most cleverly captained, with centres and cells in every district, utilizing an espionage in ever land,
       with high-placed adherents at court, with humble servitors in the cottage. This organization,
       witchcraft, maintained a relentless and ruthless war against the prevailing order and settled state.
       No design was too treacherous, no betrayal was too cowardly, no blackmail too base and foul. The
       Masters lured their subjects with magnificent promises, they lured and deluded and victimized.
       Not the least dreaded and dreadful weapon in their armament was the ancient and secret
       knowledge of poisons (veneficia), of herbs healing and hurtful, a tradition and a lore which had
       been handed down from remotest antiquity.
            Little wonder, then, that later social historians, such as Charles Mackay and Lecky, both
       absolutely impartial and unprejudiced writers, sceptical even, devote many pages, the result of
       long and laborious research, to witchcraft. The did not believe in witchcraft as in any sense
       supernatural, although perhaps abnormal. But the centuries of which they were writing believed
       intensely in it, and it was their business as scholars to examine and explain the reasons for such
       belief. It was by no means all mediæval credulity and ignorance and superstition. MacKay and
       Lecky fully recognized this, as indeed they were in all honesty bound to do. They met with facts,
       hard facts, which could neither have been accidents nor motiveless, and these facts must be
       accounted for and elucidated. The profoundest thinkers, the acutest and most liberal minds of their
       day, such men as Cardan; Trithemius; the encylcopædic Delrio; Bishop Binsfeld; the learned
       physician, Caspar Peucer; Jean Bodin; Sir Edward Coke, “father of the English law”; Francis
       Bacon; Malebranche; Bayle; Glanvil; Sir Thomas Browne; Cotton Mather; all these, and scores
       besides, were convinced of the dark reality of witchcraft, of the witch organization. Such a
       consensus of opinion throughout the years cannot be lightly dismissed.
            The literature of the subject, discussing it in every detail, from every point of view, from
       every angle, is enormous. For example, such a Bibliography as that of Yve-Plessis, 1900, which
       deals only with leading French cases and purports to be no more than a supplement to the
       Bibliographies of Græsse, the Catalogues of the Abbé Sépher, Ouvaroff, the comte d'Ourches, the
       forty-six volumes of Dr. Hoefer, Shieble, Stanislas de Guaita, and many more, lists nearly 2,000
       items, and in a note we are warned that the work is very far from complete. The Manuel
       Bibliographique, 3 vols., 1912, of Albert L. Caillet, gives 11,648 items. Caillet has many
       omissions, some being treatises of the first importance. The library of witchcraft may without
       exaggeration be said to be incalculable.
             It is hardly disputed that in the whole vast literature of witchcraft, the most prominent, the
       most important, the most authorative volume is the Malleus Maleficarum (The Witch Hammer) of
       Heinrich Kramer (Henricus Institoris) and James Sprenger. The date of the first edition of the
       Malleus cannot be fixed with absolute certainty, but the likeliest year is 1486. There were, at any
       rate, fourteen editions between 1487 and 1520, and at least sixteen editions between 1574 and
       1669. These were issued from the leading German, French and Italian presses. The latest reprint of
       the original text of the Malleus is to be found in the noble four volume collection of Treatises on
       Witchcraft, “sumptibus Claudii Bourgeat”, 4to., Lyons, 1669. There is a modern German
       translation by J.W.R. Schmidt, Der Hexehammer, 3 vols., Berlin, 1906; second edition, 1922-3.
       There is also an English translation with Introduction, Bibliography, and Notes by Montague
       Summers, published John Rodker, 1928.
             The Malleus acquired especial weight and dignity from the famous Bull of Pope Innocent
       VIII, Summis desiderantes affectibus of 9 December, 1484, in which the Pontiff, lamenting the
       power and prevalence of the witch organization, delegates Heinrich Kramer and James Sprenger as
       inquisitors of these pravities throughout Northern Germany, particularly in the provinces and
       dioceses of Mainz, Cologne, Tréves, Salzburg, and Bremen, granting both and either of them an
       exceptional authorization, and by Letters Apostolic requiring the Bishop of Strasburg, Albrecht
       von Bayern (1478-1506), not only to take steps to publish and proclaim the Bull, but further to
       afford Kramer and Sprenger every assistance, even calling in, if necessary, the help of the secular
       arm.
             This Bull, which was printed as the Preface to the Malleus, was thus, comments Dr. H.C. Lea,
       “spread broadcast over Europe”. In fact, “it fastened on European jurisprudence for nearly three
       centuries the duty of combating” the Society of Witches. The Malleus lay on the bench of every
       magistrate. It was the ultimate, irrefutable, unarguable authority. It was implicitly accepted not
       only by Catholic but by Protestant legislature. In fine, it is not too much to say that the Malleus
       Maleficarum is among the most important, wisest, and weightiest books of the world.
             It has been asked whether Kramer or Sprenger was principally responsible for the Malleus,
       but in the case of so close a collaboration any such inquiry seems singularly superflous and
       nugatory. With regard to instances of jointed authorship, unless there be some definite declaration
       on the part of one of the authors as to his particular share in a work, or unless there be some
       unusual and special circumstances bearing on the point, such perquisitions and analysis almost
       inevitably resolve themselves into a cloud of guess-work and bootless hazardry and vague perhaps.
       It becomes a game of literary blind-man's-bluff.
             Heinrich Kramer was born at Schlettstadt, a town of Lower Alsace, situated some twenty-six
       miles southwest of Strasburg. At an early age he entered the Order of S. Dominic, and so
       remarkable was his genius that whilst still a young man he was appointed to the position of Prior
       of the Dominican House at his native town, Schlettstadt. He was a Preacher-General and a Master
       of Sacred Theology. P.G. and S.T.M., two distinctions in the Dominican Order. At some date
       before 1474 he was appointed an Inquisitor for the Tyrol, Salzburg, Bohemia, and Moravia. His
       eloquence in the pulpit and tireless activity received due recognition at Roma, and for many years
       he was Spiritual Director of the great Dominican church at Salzburg, and the right-hand of the
       Archbishop of Salzburg, a munificent prelat who praises him highly in a letter which is still extant.
       In the late autumn or winter of 1485 Kramer had already drawn up a learned instruction or treatise
       on the subject of witchcraft. This circulated in manuscript, and is (almost in its entirety)

       incorporated in the Malleus. By the Bull of Innocent VIII in December, 1484, he had already been
       associated with James Sprenger to make inquisition for and try witches and sorcerers. In 1495, the
       Master General of the Order, Fr. Joaquin de Torres, O.P., summoned Kramer to Venice in order
       that he might give public lectures, disputations which attracted crowded audiences, and which
       were honoured by the presence and patronage of the Patriarch of Venice. He also strenuously
       defended the Papal supremacy, confuting the De Monarchia of the Paduan jurisconsult, Antonio
       degli Roselli. At Venice he resided at the priory of Santi Giovanni e Paolo (S. Zanipolo). During
       the summer of 1497, he had returned to Germany, and was living at the convent of Rohr, near
       Regensburg. On 31 January, 1500, Alexander VI appointed him as Nuncio and Inquisitor of
       Bohemia and Moravia, in which provinces he was deputed and empowered to proceed against the
       Waldenses and Picards, as well as against the adherents of the witch-society. He wrote and
       preached with great fervour until the end. He died in Bohemia in 1505.
             His chief works, in addition to the Malleus, are: Several Discourses and Various Sermons
       upon the Most Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist; Nuremberg, 1496; A Tract Confuting the Errors
       of Master Antonio degli Roselli; Venice, 1499; and The Shield of Defence of the Holy Roman
       Church Against the Picards and Waldenses; an incunabulum, without date, but almost certainly
       1499-1500. Many learned authors quote and refer to these treatises in terms of highest praise.
             James Sprenger was born in Basel, 1436-8. He was admitted a novice in the Dominican house
       of this town in 1452. His extraordinary genius attracted immediate attention, and his rise to a
       responsible position was very rapid. According to Pierre Hélyot, the Fransican (1680-1716),
       Histoire des Ordres Religieux, III (1715), ch. XXVI, in 1389 Conrad of Prussia abolished certain
       relaxations and abuses which had crept into the Teutonic Province of the Order of S. Dominic, and
       restored the Primitive and Strict Obedience. He was closely followed by Sprenger, whose zealous
       reform was so warmly approved that in 1468 the General Chapter ordered him to lecture on the
       sentences of Peter Lombard at the University of Cologne, to which he was thus officially attached.
       A few years later he proceeded Master of Theology, and was elected Prior and Regent of Studies
       of the Cologne Convent, one of the most famous and frequented Houses of the Order. On 30 June,
       1480, he was elected Dean of the Faculty of Theology at the University. His lecture-room was
       thronged, and in the following year, at the Chapter held in Rome, the Master General of the Order,
       Fra Salvo Cusetta, appointed him Inquisitor Extraordinary for the Provinces of Mainz, Trèves, and
       Cologne. His activities were enormous, and demanded constant journeyings through the very
       extensive district to which he had been assigned. In 1488 he was elected Provincial of the whole
       German Province, an office of the first importance. It is said that his piety and his learning
       impressed all who came in contact with him. In 1495 he was residing at Cologne, and here he
       received a letter from Alexander VI praising his enthusiasm and his energy. He died rather
       suddenly, in the odour of sanctity - some chronicles call him “Beatus” - on 6 December, 1495, at
       Strasburg, where he is buried.
             Among Sprenger's other writings, excepting the Malleus, are The Paradoxes of John of
       Westphalia Refuted, Mainz, 1479, a closely argued treatise; and The Institution and Approbation of
       the Confraternity of the Most Holy Rosary, which was first erected at Cologne on 8 September in
       the year 1475, Cologne, 1475. Sprenger may well be called the “Apostle of the Rosary”. None
       more fervent than he in spreading this Dominican elevation. His zeal enrolled thousands, including
       the Emperor Frederick III, in the Confraternity of the Most Holy Rosary, which was enriched with
       many indulgences by a Bull of Sixtus IV. It has been observed that the writings of Father James
       Sprenger on the Rosary are well approved by many learned men, Pontiffs, Saints and Theologians

       alike. There can be no doubt that Sprenger was a mystic of the highest order, a man of most saintly
       life.
             The Dominican chroniclers, such as Quétif and Echard, number Kramer and Sprenger among
       the glories and heroes of their Order.
             Certain it is that the Malleus Maleficarum is the most solid, the most important work in the
       whole vast library of witchcraft. One turns to it again and again with edification and interest: From
       the point of psychology, from the point of jurisprudence, from the point of history, it is supreme. It
       has hardly too much to say that later writers, great as they are, have done little more than draw
       from the seemingly inexhaustible wells of wisdom which the two Dominicans, Heinrich Kramer
       and James Sprenger, have given us in the Malleus Maleficarum.
             What is most surprising is the modernity of the book. There is hardly a problem, a complex, a
       difficulty, which they have not foreseen, and discussed, and resolved.
             Here are cases which occur in the law-courts to-day, set out with the greatest clarity, argued
       with unflinching logic, and judged with scrupulous impartiality.
             It is a work which must irresistibly capture the attention of all mean who think, all who see,
       or are endeavouring to see, the ultimate reality beyond the accidents of matter, time and space.
             The Malleus Maleficarum is one of the world's few books written sub specie aeternitatis.

NOTA - To Dr. H.J. Norma I wish to express my grateful thanks for his kindness in having read through the proofs of the
 Malleus Maleficarum. Those who realize the labour and sacrifice of time such a task demands will best appreciate the
                                     value of such generous assistance. - M.S.

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM

                         INTRODUCTION TO 1928 EDITION
             It has been recognized even from the very earliest times, during the first gropings towards the
       essential conveniences of social decency and social order, that witchcraft is an evil thing, an
       enemy to light, an ally of the powers of darkness, disruption, and decay. Sometimes, no doubt,
       primitive communities were obliged to tolerate the witch and her works owing to fear; in other
       words, witchcraft was a kind of blackmail; but directly Cities were able to to co-ordinate, and it
       became possible for Society to protect itself, precautions were taken and safeguards were instituted
       against this curse, this bane whose object seemed to blight all that was fair, all that was just and
       good, and that was well-appointed and honourable, in a word, whose aim proved to be set up on
       high the red standard of revolution; to overwhelm religion, existing order, and the comeliness of
       life in an abyss of anarchy, nihilism, and despair. In his great treatise De Ciutate Dei S. Augustine
       set forth the theory, or rather the living fact, of the two Cities, the City of God, and the opposing
       stronghold of all that is not for God, that is to say, of all that is against Him.
             This seems to be a natural truth which the inspired Doctor has so eloquently demonstrated in
       his mighty pages, and even before the era of Christianity men recognized the verity, and nations
       who had never heard the Divine command put into practice the obligation of the Mosaic maxim:
       Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. (Vulgate: Maleficos non patieris uiuere. Douay: Wizards thou
       shalt not suffer to live. Exodus, xxii, 18.)
             It is true that both in the Greek and in the earlier Roman cults, worships often directly derived
       from secret and sombre sources, ancient gods, or rather demons, had their awful superstitions and
       their horrid rites, powers whom men dreaded but out of very terror placated; fanes men loathed but
       within whose shadowed portals they bent and bowed the knee perforce in trembling fear. Such
       deities were the Thracian Bendis, whose manifestation was heralded by the howling of her fierce
       black hounds, and Hecate the terrible “QUeen of the realm of ghosts,” as Euripides calls her, and
       the vampire Mormo and the dark Summanus who at midnight hurled loud thunderbolts and
       launched the deadly levin through the starless sky. Pliny tells us that the worship of this mysterious
       deity lasted long, and dogs with their puppies were sacrificed to him with atrocious cruelty, but S.
       Augustine says that in his day “one could scarce find one within a while, that had heard, nay more,
       that had read so much as the name of Summanus” (De Ciuitate Dei, iv, 23). Nevertheless there is
       only too much reason to believe that this devil-god had his votaries, although his liturgy was
       driven underground and his supplicants were obliged to assemble in remote and secret places.
       Towards the end of the fifth century, the Carthaginian Martianus Capella boldly declares that
       Summanus is none other than the lord of Hell, and he was writing, it may be remembered, only a
       few years before the birth of S. Benedict; some think that he was still alive when the Father of All
       Monks was born.
             Although in Greek States the prosecution of witches was rare, in large measure owing to the
       dread they inspired, yet cases were not unknown, for Theoris, a woman of Lemnos, who is
       denounced by Demosthenes, was publicly tried at Athens and burned for her necromancy. It is
       perhaps not impertinent to observe that many strange legends attached to the island of Lemnos,
       which is situated in the Aegaean Sea, nearly midway between Mt. Athos and the Hellespoint. It is
       one of the largest of the group, having an area of some 147 square miles. Lemnos was sacred to
       Hephaestus, who is said to have fallen here when hurled by Zeus from Olympus. The workshops
       of the Smith-God in ancient legend were supposed to be on the island, although recent geologists
       deny that this area was ever volcanic, and the fires which are spoken of as issuing from it must be
       considered gaseous. Later the officinae of Hephaestus were placed in Sicily and the Lipari Islands,
       particularly Hiera.
            The worship of Hephaestus in later days seems to have degenerated and to have been
       identified with some of the secret cults of the evil powers. This was probably due to his connexion
       with fire and also to his extreme ugliness, for he was frequently represented as a swarthy man of
       grim and forbidding aspect. It should further be noted that the old Italian deity Volcanus, with
       whom he was to be identified, is the god of destructive fire - fire considered in its rage and terror,
       as contrasted with fire which is a comfort to the human race, the kindly blaze on the hearth,
       domestic fire, presided over by the gracious lady Vesta. It is impossible not to think of the fall of
       Lucifer when one considers the legend of Hephaestus. Our Lord replied, when the disciples
       reported: Domine, etiam daemonia subiiciuntur nobis in nomine tuo (Lord, the devils also are
       subject to us in Thy Name), Uidebam Satanam sicut fulgur de coelo cadentem (I saw Satan like
       lightning falling from Heaven); and Isaias says: “Quomodo cecidisti de coelo, Lucifer, qui mane
       oriebaris? Corruisti in terram qui uulnerabas gentes?” (How art thou fallen from Heaven, O
       Lucifer, who didst rise in the morning? How art thou fallen to the earth, that didst wound the
       nations?) Milton also has the following poetic allusion:
                Nor was his name unheard or unador'd
                In Ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land
                Men called him Mulciber; and how he fell
                From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry Jove
                Sheer o'er the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn
                To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,
                A Summers day; and with the setting Sun
                Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,
                On Lemnos th' Ægæan Ile: thus they relate,
                Erring; for he with his rebellious rout
                Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him now
                To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape
                By all his Engins, but was headlong sent
                With his industrious crew to build in hell.

            Hephaestus, especially in later days, is represented with one leg shortened to denote his
       lameness; and throughout the Middle Ages it was popularly believed that his cloven hoof was the
       one feature which the devil was unable to disguise. In this connexion with Loki, the Vulcan of
       Northern Europe, will be readily remembered. Frederick Hall writes: “Hephaestos, Vulcan and
       Loki, each lame from some deformity of foot, in time joined natures with the Pans and satyrs of
       the upper world; the lame sooty blacksmith donned their goatlike extremities of cloven hoofs, tail
       and horns; and the black dwarfs became uncouth ministers of this sooty, black, found fiend. If ever
       mortal man accepted the services of these cunning metalworkers, it was for some sinister purpose,
       and at a fearful price - no less than that of the soul itself, bartered away in a contract of blood, the

       emblem of life and the colour of fire.”
            There were also dark histories of murder and blood connected with Lemnos. When the
       Argonauts landed here they found it inhabited only by Amazons, who, having murdered all their
       husbands, had chosen as their queen Hypsipyle, daughter of Thoas, whom she secretly preserved
       alive. When this was discovered the unfortunate woman was compelled to leave the island, and
       being subsequently captured by pirates she was sold to Lycurgus, king of the sacred groves that
       surrounded the temple of Zeus Nemeus in a remote Argive valley. Hypsipyle here became the
       nurse of the mysterious child Archemorus, the Forerunner of Death, who was bitten by a magic
       serpent and vanished, portending the doom of the Seven who went against Thebes.
            At a later time the Pelasgians are said to have massacred the inhabitants of Lemnos, and to
       have settled there with some Athenian maidens they had carried off from Attica. Afterwards these
       savages murdered both their wives and their children. In consequence of such atrocities Lemnian
       deeds became proverbial in Greek for horrors and sorceries. It is curious to remark that a certain
       red clay (terra Lemnia) found on the island was, as Pliny tells us, employed as a remedy for
       wounds, and especially the bite of a snake. This latter may have some obscure connexion with the
       story of Archemorus. In any case enough has been said to show that this island was considered a
       land of mystery and ancient terrors, a fitting origin for the witch Theoris.
            In Rome black magic was punished as a capital offence by the Law of the Twelve Tables,
       which are to be assigned to the fifth century B.C., and, as Livy records, from time to time
       Draconian statutes were directed against those who attempted to blight crops and vineyards or to
       spread rinderpest amongst flocks and cattle. None the less it is evident from many Latin authors
       and from the historians that Rome swarmed with occultists and diviners, many of whom in spite of
       the Lex Cornelia almost openly traded in poisons, and not infrequently in assassination to boot.
       Sometimes, as in the Middle Ages, a circumstance of which the Malleus Maleficarum most
       particularly complains, the sorcerers were protected by men of wealth and high estate. This was
       especially the case in the terrible days of Marius and of Catiline, and during the extreme decadence
       of the latest Caesars. Yet, paradoxical as it may appear, such emperors as Augustus, Tiberius, and
       Septimius Severus, whilst banishing from their realms all seers and necromancers, and putting
       them to death, in private entertained astrologers and wizards among their retinue, consulting their
       art upon each important occasion, and often even in the everyday and ordinary affairs of life.
            Nevertheless it must be noted that all the while normal legislation utterly condemned
       witchcraft and its works, whilst the laws were not merely carried out to their very letter, but
       reinforced by such emperors as Claudius, Vitelius, and Vespasian.
            These prosecutions are very significant, and I have insisted upon them in some detail, as I
       wish to emphasize that stern and constant official opposition to witchcraft, and the prohibition
       under severest penalties, the sentence of death itself, of any practice or pursuit of these dangerous
       and irreligious arts, was demonstrably not a product of Christianity, but had long and necessarily
       been employed in the heathen world and among pagan peoples and among polytheistic societies.
       Moreover, there are even yet savage communities who visit witchcraft with death.
            Accordingly, if we cite the Vincentian cannon, quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus,
       we might surely say that from the earliest dawn of civilization witchcraft has been prohibited,
       hated, and feared.
            At the time of the triumph of Christianity a decadent Empire in the last throes of paganism
       was corroded by every kind of superstition and occult art, from the use of petty and harmless
       sympathetic charms of healing to the darkest crimes of goetic ceremonial. Spells, scrying,

       conjurations, evokings of the dead were never more fashionable and never more keenly explored
       by every class and ever order, from the divine Caesar in his palace to the losel peasant in his
       humble shed. If the disease is universal, the medicine must be sharp. It was very difficult, when the
       infection of crime was so general, to discriminate and draw the line, to take into consideration
       relative differences and nice gradations. So much that was heathen, so much that was bad, was
       mixed up with what might seem to be simple credulity, and the harmless folk-customs of some
       grandam tradition and immemorial usage, a song or a country dance mayhap, innocent enough on
       the surface, and even pleasing, so often were but the cloak and the mask for something devilish
       and obscene, that the Church deemed it necessary to forbid and proscribe the whole superstition
       even when it manifested itself in modest fashion and seemed guileless, innoxious, and of no
       account. Thus, for example, to make a wind blow or to drop in a world-wide fantasy which appears
       harmless enough. The Esthonians when they wish to raise a wind strike a knife into a house-beam
       in the direction from which they desire the wind to blow, while at the same time they croon an
       old-time canzonet. The underlying idea is that the gentle wind will not let any innocent thing, not
       even a beam, suffer without coming swiftly and breathing softly thereon to assuage the pain. But at
       Constantinople, in the reign of Constantine, a warlock named Sopater was put to death on a charge
       of binding the winds by magic, which he had at any rate esssayed to do, whether or no the fact that
       the cornships of Egypt and Syria were detained on their voyage by calms and headwinds was
       actually due to his interference. The city was nearly starved, and the Byzantine mob, clamouring
       for bread, was ready to break out into the wildest excesses. In Scotland witches used to raise the
       wind by dipping the corner of a plaid in water and beating it thrice upon a stone, crooning the
       following words:
                I knok this rage upone this stane
                To raise the wind in the divellis name,
                It sall not lye till I please againe.

       It will readily be remembered that one of the chief charges brought against the coven of North
       Berwick witches during the famous trial of 1590 was that they performed incantations to raise a
       tempest which might wreck the fleet that was escorting James VI when he brought his queen,
       Anne of Denmark, from her native country to Scotland. So we see that a superstition which in a
       little fishing village, when some mother was calling a fair wind for her son, or some lass whistled
       for a gentle breeze to fill the sails of her sweetheart's trawler, was simple and kindly enough, might
       yet become dangerous and deadly at least in intent when launched be malevolent witches who had
       the will if not the power to destroy, and who if this means failed would hasten to employ other
       methods that should prove far more resourceful in their means and efficacious in their results.

           The influence of this Saint over the dark powers was very remarkable, and he is especially
        venerated as “effugator daemonu.” The Medal of S. Benedict has been found to be extremely
        potent against all evil spells. During a trial for witchcraft in 1647 at Nattenberg near the Abbey of
        Metten in Bavaria, the sorcerers acknowledged that their attempts against the monks were foiled
        by the holy Medal. The possessed boys of Illfurt (Alsace), 1864-69, exhibited the utmost dread of S.
        Benedict's Medal.

                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM

                         INTRODUCTION TO 1928 EDITION
             Accordingly, during the years 319-21 a number of laws were passed which penalized and
       punished the craft of magic with the utmost severity. A pagan diviner or haruspex could only
       follow his vocation under very definite restrictions. He was not allowed to be an intimate visitor at
       the house of any citizen, for friendship with men of this kind must be avoided. “The haruspex who
       frequents the houses of others shall die at the stake,” such is the tenor of the code. It is hardly an
       exaggeration to say that almost every year saw a more rigid application of the laws; although even
       as to-day, when fortune-telling and peering into the future are forbidden by the Statute-Book,
       diviners and mediums abound, so then in spite of every prohibition astrologers, clairvoyants, and
       palmists had an enormous clientèle of rich and poor alike. However, under Valens, owing to his
       discovery of the damning fact that certain prominent courtiers had endeavoured by means ot
       table-rapping to ascertain who should be his successor upon the throne, in the year 367 a regular
       crusade, which in its details recalls the heyday of Master Matthew Hopkins, was instituted against
       the whole race of magicians, soothsayers, mathematici, and theurgists, which perhaps was the first
       general prosecution during the Christian era. Large numbers of persons, including no doubt many
       innocent as well as guilty, were put to death, and a veritable panic swept through the Eastern
       world.
             The early legal codes of most European nations contain laws directed against witchcraft.
       Thus, for example, the oldest document of Frankish legislation, the Salic Law (Lex salica), which
       was reduced to a written form and promulgated under Clovis, who died 27 November, 511, mulcts
       (sic) those who practise magic with various fines, especially when it could be proven that the
       accused launched a deadly curse, or had tied the Witch's Knot. This latter charm was usually a
       long cord tightly tied up in elaborate loops, among whose reticulations it was customary to insert
       the feathers of a black hen, a raven, or some other bird which had, or was presumed to have, no
       speck of white. This is one of the oldest instruments of witchcraft and is known in all countries and
       among all nations. It was put to various uses. The wizards of Finland, when they sold wind in the
       three knots of a rope. If the first knot were undone a gentle breeze sprang up; if the second, it blew
       a mackerel gale; if the third, a hurricane. But the Witch's Ladder, as it was often known, could be
       used with far more baleful effects. The knots were tied with certain horrid maledictions, and then
       the cord was hidden away in some secret place, and unless it were found and the strands released
       the person at whom the curse was directed would pine and die. This charm continually occurs
       during the trials. Thus in the celebrated Island-Magee case, March 1711, when a coven of witches
       was discovered, it was remarked that an apron belonging to Mary Dunbar, a visitor at the house of
       the afflicted persons, had been abstracted. Miss Dunbar was suddenly seized with fits and
       convulsions, and sickened almost to death. After most diligent search the missing garment was
       found carefully hidden away and covered over, and a curious string which had nine knots in it had
       been so tied up with the folds of the linen that it was beyond anything difficult to separate them
       and loosen the ligatures. In 1886 in the old belfry of a village church in England there were
       accidentally discovered, pushed away in a dark corner, several yards of incle braided with
       elaborate care and having a number of black feathers thrust through the strands. It is said that for a
       long while considerable wonder was caused as to what it might be, but when it was exhibited and
       became known, one of the local grandmothers recognized it was a Witch's Ladder, and, what is
       extremely significant, when it was engraved in the Folk Lore Journal an old Italian woman to
       whom the picture was shown immediately identified it as la ghirlanda delle streghe.
             The laws of the Visigoths, which were to some extent founded upon the Roman law, punished
       witches who had killed any person by their spells with death; whilst long-continued and obstinate
       witchcraft, if fully proven, was visited with such severe sentences as slavery for life. In 578, when
       a son of Queen Fredegonde died, a number of witches who were accused of having contrived the
       destruction of the Prince were executed. It has been said in these matters that the ecclesiastical law
       was tolerant, since for the most part it contented itself with a sentence of excommunication. But
       those who consider this spiritual outlawry lenient certainly do not appreciate what such a doom
       entailed. Moreover, after a man had been condemned to death by the civil courts it would have
       been somewhat superfluous to have repeated the same sentence, and beyond the exercise of her
       spiritual weapons, what else was there left for the Church to do?
             In 814, Louis le Pieux upon his accession to the throne began to take very active measures
       against all sorcerers and necromancers, and it was owing to his influence and authority that the
       Council of Paris in 829 appealed to the secular courts to carry out any such sentences as the
       Bishops might pronounce. The consequence was that from this time forward the penalty of
       witchcraft was death, and there is evidence that if the constituted authority, either ecclesiastical or
       civil, seemed to slacken in their efforts the populace took the law into their own hands with far
       more fearful results.
             In England the early Penitentials are greatly concerned with the repression of pagan
       ceremonies, which under the cover of Christian festivities were very largely practised at Christmas
       and on New Year's Day. These rites were closely connected with witchcraft, and especially do S.
       Theodore, S. Aldhelm, Ecgberht of York, and other prelates prohibit the masquerade as a horned
       animal, a stag, or a bull, which S. Caesarius of Arles had denounced as a “foul tradition,” an “evil
       custom,” a “most heinous abomination.” These and even stronger expressions would not be used
       unless some very dark and guilty secrets had been concealed beneath this mumming, which,
       however foolish, might perhaps have been thought to be nothing worse, so that to be so roundly
       denounced as devilish and demoniacal they must certainly have had some very grim signification
       which did not appear upon the surface. The laws of King Athelstan (924-40), corresponsive with
       the early French laws, punished any person casting a spell which resulted in death by extracting
       the extreme penalty. During the eleventh and twelfth centuries there are few cases of witchcraft in
       England, and such accusations as were made appeared to have been brought before the
       ecclesiastical court. It may be remarked, however, that among the laws attributed to King Kenneth
       I of Scotland, who ruled from 844 to 860, and under whom the Scots of Dalriada and the Pictish
       peoples may be said to have been united in one kingdom, is an important statute which enacts that
       all sorcerers and witches, and such as invoke spirits, “and use to seek upon them for helpe, let
       them be burned to death.” Even then this was obviously no new penalty, but the statutory
       confirmation of a long-established punishment. So the witches of Forres who attempted the life of
       King Duffus in the year 968 by the old bane of slowly melting a wax image, when discovered,
       were according to the law burned at the stake.
             The conversion of Germany to Christianity was late and very slow, for as late as the eighth
       century, in spite of the heroic efforts of S. Columbanus, S. Fridolin, S. Gall, S. Rupert, S.
       Willibrod, the great S. Boniface, and many others, in spite of the headway that had been made,
       various districts were always relapsing into a primitive and savage heathenism. For example, it is
       probably true to say that the Prussian tribles were not stable in their conversion until the beginning
       of the thirteenth century, when Bishop Albrecht reclaimed the people by a crusade. However,
       throughout the eleventh and the twelfth centuries there are continual instances of persons who had
       practised witchcraft being put to death, and the Emperor Frederick II, in spite of the fact that he
       was continually quarrelling with the Papacy and utterly indifferent to any religious obligation -
       indeed it has been said that he was “a Christian ruler only in name,” and “throughout his reign he
       remained virtually a Moslem free-thinker” - declared that a law which he had enacted for
       Lombardy should have force throughout the whole of his dominions. “Henceforth,” Vacandard
       remarks, “all uncertainty was at an end. The legal punishment for heresy throughout the empire
       was death at the stake.” It must be borne in mind that witchcraft and heresy were almost
       inextricably commingled. It is quite plain that such a man as Frederick, whose whole philosophy
       was entirely Oriental; who was always accompanied by a retinue of Arabian ministers, courtiers,
       and officers; who was perhaps not without reason suspected of being a complete agnostic, recked
       little whether heresy and witchcraft might be offences against the Church or not, but he was
       sufficiently shrewd to see that they gravely threatened the well-being of the State, imperilling the
       maintenance of civilization and the foundations of society.
              This brief summary of early laws and ancient ordinances has been given in order to show that
       the punishment of witchcraft certainly did not originate in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,
       and most assuredly was not primarily the concern of the Inquisition. In fact, curiously enough,
       Bernard Gui, the famous Inquisitor of Toulouse, laid down in his Practica Inquisitionis that
       sorcery itself did not fall within the cognizance of the Holy Office, and in every case, unless there
       were other circumstances of which his tribunal was bound to take notice when witches came
       before him, he simply passed them on to the episcopal courts.
              It may be well here very briefly to consider the somewhat complicated history of the
       establishment of the Inquisition, which was, it must be remembered, the result of the tendencies
       and growth of many years, by no mens a judicial curia with cut-and-dried laws and a compete
       procedure suddenly called into being by one stroke of a Papal pen. In the first place, S. Dominic
       was in no sense the founder of the Inquisition. Certainly during the crusade in Languedoc he was
       present, reviving religion and reconciling the lapsed, but he was doing no more than S. Paul or any
       of the Apostles would have done. The work of S. Dominic was preaching and the organization of
       his new Order, which received Papal confirmation from Honorius III, and was approved in the
       Bull Religiosam uitam, 22 December, 1216. S. Dominic died 6 August, 1221, and even if we take
       the word in a very broad sense, the first Dominican Inquisitor seems to have been Alberic, who in
       November, 1232, was travelling through Lombardy with the official title of “Inquisitor hereticae
       prauitatis.” The whole question of the episcopal Inquisitors, who were really the local bishop, his
       archdeacons, and his diocesan court, and their exact relationship with the travelling Inquisitors,
       who were mainly drawn from the two Orders of friars, the Franciscan and the Dominican, is
       extremely nice and complicated; whilst the gradual effacement of the episcopal courts with regard
       to certain matters and the consequent prominence of the Holy Office were circumstances and
       conditions which realized themselves slowly enough in all countries, and almost imperceptibly in
       some districts, as necessity required, without any sudden break or sweeping changes. In fact we
       find that the Franciscan or Dominican Inquisitor simply sat as an assessor in the episcopal court so

       that he could be consulted upon certain technicalities and deliver sentence conjointly with the
       Bishop if these matters were involved. Thus at the trial of Gilles de Rais in October, 1440, at
       Nantes, the Bishop of Nantes presided over the court with the bishops of Le Mans, Saint-Brieuc,
       and Saint-Lo as his coadjutors, whilst Pierre de l’Hospital, Chencellor of Brittany, watched the
       case on behalf of the civil authorities, and Frère Jean Blouin was present as the delegate of the
       Holy Inquisition for the city and district of Nantes. Owing to the multiplicity of the crimes, which
       were proven and clearly confessed in accordance with legal requirements, it was necessary to
       pronounce two sentences. The first sentence was passed by the Bishop of Nantes conjointly with
       the Inquisitor. By them Gilles de Rais was declared guilty of Satanism, sorcery, and apostasy, and
       there and then handed over to the civil arm to receive the punishment due to such offences. The
       second sentence, pronounced by the Bishop alone, declared the prisoner convicted of sodomy,
       sacrilege, and violation of ecclesiastical rights. The ban of excommunication was lifted since the
       accused had made a clean breast of his crimes and desired to be reconciled, but he was handed
       over to the secular court, who sentenced him to death, on multiplied charges of murder as well as
       on account of the aforesaid offences.
             It must be continually borne in mind also, and this is a fact which is very often slurred over
       and forgotten, that the heresies of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, to cope with which the
       tribunal of the Inquisition was primarily organized and regularized, were by no means mere
       theoretical speculations, which, however erroneous and dangerous in the fields of thought,
       practically and in action would have been arid and utterly unfruitful. To-day the word “heresy”
       seems to be as obsolete and as redolent of a Wardour-street vocabulary as if one were to talk of a
       game of cards at Crimp or Incertain, and to any save a dusty mediaevalist it would appear to be an
       antiquarian term. It was far other in the twelfth century; the wild fanatics who fostered the most
       subversive and abominable ideas aimed to put these into actual practice, to establish communities
       and to remodel whole territories according to the programme which they had so carefully
       considered in every detail with a view to obtaining and enforcing their own ends and their own
       interests. The heretics were just as resolute and just as practical, that is to say, just as determined to
       bring about the domination of their absolutism as is any revolutionary of to-day. The aim and
       objects of their leaders, Tanchelin, Everwacher, the Jew Manasses, Peter Waldo, Pierre Autier,
       Peter of Bruys, Arnold of Brescia, and the rest, were exactly those of Lenin, Trotsky, Zinoviev,
       and their fellows. There were, of course, minor differences and divergences in their tenets, that is
       to say, some had sufficient cunning to conceal and even to deny the extremer views which other
       were bold enough or mad enough more openly to proclaim. But just below the trappings, a little
       way beneath the surface, their motives, their methods, their intentions, the goal to which they
       pressed, were all the same. Their objects may be summed up as the abolition of monarchy, the
       abolition of private property and of inheritance, the abolition of marriage, the abolition of order,
       the total abolition of all religion. It was against this that the Inquisition had to fight, and who can
       be surprised if, when faced with so vast a conspiracy, the methods employed by the Holy Office
       may not seem - if the terrible conditions are conveniently forgotten - a little drastic, a little severe?
       There can be no doubt that had this most excellent tribunal continued to enjoy its full prerogative
       and the full exercise of its salutary powers, the world at large would be in a far happier and far
       more orderly position to-day. Historians may point out diversities and dissimilarities between the
       teaching of the Waldenses, the Albigenses, the Henricans, the Poor Men of Lyons, the Cathari, the
       Vaudois, the Bogomiles, and the Manichees, but they were in reality branches and variants of the
       same dark fraternity, just as the Third International, the Anarchists, the Nihilists, and the
       Bolsheviks are in every sense, save the mere label, entirely identical.

                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM

                         INTRODUCTION TO 1928 EDITION
             In fact heresy was one huge revolutionary body, exploiting its forces through a hundred
       different channels and having as its object chaos and corruption. The question may be asked -
       What was their ultimate aim in wishing to destroy civilization? What did they hope to gain by it?
       Precisely the same queries have been put and are put to-day with regard to these political parties.
       There is an apparent absence of motive in this seemingly aimless campaign of destruction to
       extermination carried on by the Bolsheviks in Russia, which has led many people to inquire what
       the objective can possibly be. So unbridled are the passions, so general the demolition, so terrible
       the havoc, that hard-headed individuals argue that so complete a chaos and such revolting outrages
       could only be affected by persons who were enthusiasts in their own cause and who had some very
       definite aims thus positively to pursue. The energizing forces of this fanaticism, this fervent zeal,
       do not seem to be any more apparent than the end, hence more than one person has hesitated to
       accept accounts so alarming of massacres and carnage, or wholesale imprisonments, tortures, and
       persecutions, and has begun to suspect that the situation may be grossly exaggerated in the
       overcharged reports of enemies and the highly-coloured gossip of scare-mongers. Nay, more,
       partisans have visited the country and returned with glowing tales of a new Utopia. It cannot be
       denied that all this is a very clever game. It is generally accepted that from very policy neither an
       individual nor a junto or confederacy will act even occasionally, much less continually and
       consistently, in a most bloody and tyrannical way, without some very well-arranged programme is
       being thus carried out and determinate aim ensued, conditions and object which in the present case
       it seems extremely difficult to guess at and divine unless we are to attribute the revolution to
       causes the modern mind is apt to dismiss with impatience and intolerance.
             Nearly a century and a half ago Anacharsis Clootz, “the personal enemy of Jesus Christ” as
       he openly declared himself, was vociferating “God is Evil,” “To me then Lucifer, Satan! whoever
       you may be, the demon that the faith of my fathers opposed to God and the Church.” This is the
       credo of the witch.
             Although it may not be generally recognized, upon a close investigation it seems plain that
       the witches were a vast political movement, an organized society which was anti-social and
       anarchichal, a world-wide plot against civilization. Naturally, although the Masters were often
       individuals of high rank and deep learning, that rank and file of the society, that is to say, those
       who for the most part fell into the hands of justice, were recruited from the least educated classes,
       the ignorant and the poor. As one might suppose, many of the branches or covens in remoter
       districts knew nothing and perhaps could have understood nothing of the enormous system.
       Nevertheless, as small cogs in a very small wheel, it might be, they were carrying on the work and
       actively helping to spread the infection. It is an extremely significant fact that the last regularly
       official trial and execution for witchcraft in Western Europe was that of Anna Goeldi, who was

       hanged at Glaris in Switzerland, 17 June, 1782. Seven years before, in 1775, the villian Adam
       Weishaupt, who has been truly described by Louis Blac as “the profoundest conspirator that has
       ever existed,” formed his “terrible and formidable sect,” the Illuminati. The code of this
       mysterious movement lays down: “it is also necessary to gain the common people (das gemeine
       Volk) to our Order. The great means to that end is influence in the schools.” This is exactly the
       method of the organizations of witches, and again and again do writers lament and bewail the
       endless activities of this sect amongst the young people and even the children of the district. So in
       the prosecutions at Würzburg we find that there were condemned boys of ten and eleven, two choir
       boys aged twelve, “a boy of twelve years old in one of the lower forms of the school,” “the two
       young sons of the Prince's cook, the eldest fourteen, the younger twelve years old,” several pages
       and seminarists, as well as a number of young girls, amongst whom “a child of nine or ten years
       old and her little sister” were involved.
             The political operations of the witches in many lands were at their trials exposed time after
       time, and these activities are often discernible even when they did not so publicly and prominently
       come to light. A very few cases, to which we must make but brief and inadequate reference, will
       stand for many. In England in the year 1324 no less than twenty-seven defendants were tried at the
       King's Bench for plotting against and endeavouring to kill Edward II, together with many
       prominent courtiers and officials, by the practice of magical arts. A number of wealthy citizens of
       Coventry had hired a famous “nigromauncer,” John of Nottingham, to slay not only the King, but
       also the royal favourite, Hugh le Despenser, and his father; the Prior of Coventry; the monastic
       steward; the manciple; and a number of other important personages. A secluded old manor-house,
       some two or three miles out of Coventry, was put at the disposal of Master John, and there he and
       his servant, Robert Marshall, promptly commenced business. They went to work in the bad
       old-fashioned way of modelling wax dolls or mommets of those whom they wished to destroy.
       Long pins were thrust through the figures, and they were slowly melted before a fire. The first
       unfortunate upon whom this experiment was tried, Richard de Sowe, a prominent courtier and
       close friend of the King, was suddenly taken with agonizing pains, and when Marshall visited the
       house, as if casually, in order that he might report the results of this sympathetic sorcery to the
       wizard, he found their hapless victim in a high delirium. When this state of things was promptly
       conveyed to him, Master John struck a pin through the heart of the image, and in the morning the
       news reached them that de Sowe had breathed his last. Marshall, who was by now in an extremity
       of terror, betook himself to a justice and laid bare all that was happening and had happened, with
       the immediate result that Master John and the gang of conspirators were arrested. It must be
       remembered that in 1324 the final rebellion against King Edward II had openly broken forth on all
       sides. A truce of thirteen years had been arranged with Scotland, and though the English might
       refuse Bruce his royal title he was henceforward the warrior king of an independent country. It is
       true that in May, 1322, the York Parliament had not only reversed the exile of the Despensers,
       declaring the pardons which had been granted their opponents null and void, as well as voting for
       the repeal of the Ordinances of 1311, and the Despensers were working for, and fully alive to the
       necessity of, good and stable government, but none the less the situation was something more than
       perilous; the Exchequer was well-nigh drained; there was rioting and bloodshed in almost every
       large town; and worst of all, in 1323 the younger Roger Mortimer had escaped from the Tower and
       got away safely to the Continent. There were French troubles to boot; Charles IV, who in 1322 had
       succeeded to the throne, would accept no excuse from Edward for any postponement of homage,
       and in this very year, 1324, declaring the English possessions forfeited, he proceeded to occupy

       the territory with an army, when it soon became part of the French dominion. There can be not
       doubt that the citizens of Coventry were political intriguers, and since they were at the moment
       unable openly to rebel against their sovran lord, taking advantage of the fact that he was harassed
       and pressed at so critical a juncture, they proceeded against him by the dark and tortuous ways of
       black magic.
             Very many similar conspiracies in which sorcery was mixed up with treasonable practices
       and attempts might be cited, but only a few of the most important must be mentioned. Rather more
       than a century later than the reign of Edward II, in 1441, one of the greatest and most influential
       ladies in all England, “the Duchesse of Gloucestre, was arrested and put to holt, for she was
       suspecte of treson.” This, of course, was purely a political case, and the wife of Duke Humphrey
       had unfortunately by her indiscretion and something worse given her husband's enemies an
       opportunity to attack him by her ruin. An astrologer, attached to the Duke's household, when taken
       and charged with “werchyrye of sorcery against the King,” confessed that he had often cast the
       horoscope of the Duchess to find out if her husband would ever wear the English crown, the way
       to which they had attempted to smooth by making a wax image of Henry VI and melting it before
       a magic fire to bring about the King's decease. A whole crowd of witches, male and female, were
       involved in the case, and among these was Margery Jourdemain, a known a notorious invoker of
       demons and an old trafficker in evil charms. Eleanor Cobham was incontinently brought before a
       court presided over by three Bishops, London, Lincoln, and Norwich. She was found guilty both of
       high treason and sorcery, and after having been compelled to do public penance in the streets of
       London, she was imprisoned for life, according to the more authoritative account at Peel Castle in
       the Isle of Man. Her accomplices were executed at London.
             In the days of Edward IV it was commonly gossiped that the Duchess of Bedford was a
       witch, who by her spells had fascinated the King with the beauty of her daughter Elizabeth, whom
       he made his bride, in spite of the fact that he had plighted his troth to Eleanor Butler, the heiress of
       the Earl of Shrewsbury. So open did the scandal become that the Duchess of Bedford lodged an
       official complaint with the Privy Council, and an inquiry was ordered, but, as might have been
       suscepted, this completely cleared the lady. Nevertheless, five years later the charges were
       renewed by the Lord Protector, the Duke of Gloucester. Nor was this the first time in English
       history that some fair dame was said to have fascinated a monarch, not only by her beauty but also
       by unlawful means. When the so-called “Good Parliament” was convened in April, 1376, their
       first business seemed to be to attack the royal favourite, Alice Perrers, and amongst the
       multiplicity of charges which they brought against her, not the least deadly was the accusation of
       witchcraft. Her ascendancy over the King was attributed to the enchantments and experiments of a
       Dominican friar, learned in many a cantrip and cabala, whom she entertained in her house, and
       who had fashioned two pictures of Edward and Alive which, when suffumigated with the incense
       of mysterious herbs and gums, mandrakes, sweet calamus, caryophylleae, storax, benzoin, and
       other plants plucked beneath the full moon what time Venus was in ascendant, caused the old King
       to dote upon this lovely concubine. With great difficulty by a subtle ruse the friar was arrested, and
       he thought himself lucky to escape with relegation to a remote house under the strictest observance
       of his Order, whence, however, he was soon to be recalled with honour and reward, since the Good
       Parliament shortly came to an end, and Alice Perrers, who now stood higher in favour than ever,
       was not slow to heap lavish gifts upon her supporters, and to visit her enemies with condign
       punishment.
             It is often forgotten that in the troublous days of Henry VIII the whole country swarmed with

       astrologers and sorcerers, to whom high and low alike made constant resort. The King himself, a
       prey to the idlest superstitions, ever lent a credulous ear to the most foolish prophecies and old
       wives' abracadabra. When, as so speedily happened, he wearied of Anne Boleyn, he openly gave it
       as his opinion that he had “made this marriage seduced by witchcraft; and that this was evident
       because God did not permit them to have any male issue.”
             There was nobody more thoroughly scared of witchcraft than Henry's daughter, Elizabeth,
       and as John Jewel was preaching his famous sermon before her in February, 1560, he described at
       length how “this kind of people (I mean witches and sorcerers) within these few last years are
       marvellously increased within this Your Grace's realm;” he then related how owing to dark spells
       he had known many “pine away even to death.” “I pray God,” he unctuously cried, “they may
       never practise further than upon the subjects!” This was certainly enough to ensure that drastic
       laws should be passed particularly to protect the Queen, who was probably both thrilled and
       complimented to think that her life was in danger. It is exceedingly doubtful, whether there was
       any conspiracy at all which would have attempted Elizabeth's personal safety. There were, of
       course, during the imprisonment of the Queen of Scots, designs to liberate this unfortunate
       Princess, and Walsingham with his fellows used to tickle the vanity of Gloriana be regaling her
       with melodramatic accounts of dark schemes and secret machinations which they had, with a very
       shrewd knowledge of stagecraft, for the most part themselves arranged and contrived, so we may
       regard the Act of 1581, 23 Eliz., Cap. II, as mere finesse and chicane. That there were witches in
       England is very certain, but there seems no evidence at all that there were attempts upon the life of
       Elizabeth. None the less the point is important, since it shows that in men's minds sorcery was
       inexplicably mixed up with politics. The statute runs as follows: “That if any person . . . during the
       life of our said Sovereign Lady the Queen's Majesty that now is, either within her Highness'
       dominions or without, shall be setting or erecting any figure or by casting of nativities or by
       calculation or by any prophesying, witchcraft, conjurations, or other like unlawful means
       whatsoever, seek to know, and shall set forth by express words, deeds, or writings, how long her
       Majesty shall live, or who shall reign a king or queen of this realm of England after her Highness'
       decease . . . that then every such offence shall be felony, and every offender therein, and also all
       his aiders (etc.), shall be judged as felons and shall suffer pain of death and forfeit as in case of
       felony is used, without any benefit of clergy or sanctuary.”


                                                                   Page 3 of 8

           Guillotined in 1794.



           Proudhon, “La Révolution au XIXième siècle,” p. 290.



           The last trial and judicial execution in Europe itself was probably that of two aged beldames,
        Satanists, who were burned at the stake in Poland, 1793, the year of the Second Partition, during
        the reign of Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski.



            This is certainly one of the oldest and most universal of spells. To effect the death of a man, or
        to injure him by making an image in his likeness, and mutilating or destroying this image, is a
        practice found throughout the whole wide world from its earliest years. It is common both in
        Babylon and in the Egypt of the Pharoahs, when magicians kneaded puppets of clay or pitch
        moistened with honey. If it were possible to mingle therewith a drop of a man's blood, the parings
        of his nails, a few hairs from his body, a thread or two from his garments, it gave the warlock the
        greater power over him. In ancient Greece and Rome precisely the same ideas prevailed, and
        allusions may be found ni Theocritus (“Idyll” II), Vergil (“Eclogue” VIII, 75-82), Ovid
        (“Heroides,” VI, 91, sqq.; “Amores,” III, vii, 29, sqq.), and many more. (See R. Wunsch, “Eine
        antike Rachepuppe,” “Philologus,” lxi, 1902, pp. 26-31.) We find this charm among the Ojebway
        Indians, the Cora Indians of Mexico, the Malays, the Chinese and Japanese, the aborigines
        throughout Australia, the Hindoos, both in ancient India and at the present day, the Burmese,
        many Arab tribes of Northern Africa, in Turkey, in Italy and the remoter villages of France, in
        Ireland and Scotland, nor is it (in one shape and form or another) yet unknown in the country
        districts of England.



           Some of the chronicles say Chester.



          This is referred to in Heywood's “King Edward IV,” 4to, 1600, in the opening scene, where the
        Duchess of York, the King's mother says:
          O Edward, Edward! fly and leave this place,
          Wherein, poor silly King, thou are enchanted.
          This is her dam of Bedford's work, her mother,
          That hath bewitch'd thee, Edward, my poor child.



          This is probably the exact date. The discourse in question was certainly delivered between
        November, 1559, and 17 March, 1560.




                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM

                         INTRODUCTION TO 1928 EDITION
             The famous Scotch witch trial or 1590, when it was proved that upon 31 October in the
       preceding year, All Hallow E'en, a gang of more than two hundred persons had assembled for their
       rites at the old haunted church of North Berwick, where they consulted with their Master, “the
       Devil,” how they might most efficaciously kill King James, is too well known to require more than
       a passing mention, but it may be remembered that Agnes Sampson confessed that she had
       endeavoured to poison the King in various ways, and that she was also avowed that she had
       fashioned a wax mommet, saying with certain horrid maledictions as she wrought the work: “This
       is King James the sext, ordinit to be consumed at the instance of a noble man Francis Erle of
       Bodowell.” The contriver of this far-reaching conspiracy was indeed none other than Francis
       Stewart, Earl of Bothwell, who, as common knowledge bruited, almost overtly aspired to the
       throne and was perfectly reckless how he compassed his ends. It was he, no doubt, who figured as
       “the Devil” at the meeting in the deserted and ill-omened kirkyard. In fact this is almost
       conclusively shown by a statement of Barbara Napier when she was interrogated with regard to
       their objects in the attempted murder of the King. She gave as her reason “that another might have
       ruled in his Majesty's place, and the Government might have gone to the Devil.” That is to say, to
       Francis Bothwell. The birth of Prince Henry at Stirling, 19 February, 1594, and further of Prince
       Charles at Dunfermline, 19 November, 1600, must have dashed all Bothwell's hopes to the ground.
       Moreover, the vast organization of revolutionaries and witches had been completely broken up,
       and accordingly there was nothing left for him to do but to seek safety in some distant land. There
       is an extremely significant reference to him in Sandys, who, speaking of Calabria in the year 1610,
       writes: “Here a certaine Calabrian hearing that I was an English man, came to me, and would
       needs persuade me that I had insight in magicke: for the Earl Bothel was my countryman, who
       liues at Naples, and is in these parts famous for suspected negromancie.”
             In French history even more notorious than the case of the Berwick witches were the
       shocking scandals involving both poisoning and witchcraft that came to light and were being
       investigated in 1679-82. At least two hundred and fifty persons, of whom many were the
       representatives and scions of the highest houses in the land, were deeply implicated in these
       abominations, and it is no matter for surprise that a vast number of the reports and several entire
       dossiers and registers have completely disappeared. The central figures were the Abbé Guibourg
       and Catherine Deshayes, more generally known as La Voisin, whose house in the Rue Beauregard
       was for years the rendezvous of a host of inquirers drawn from all classes of societym from
       palaces and prisons, from the lowest slums of the vilest underworld. That it was a huge and
       far-reaching political conspiracy is patent form the fact that the lives of Louis XIV, the Queen, the
       Dauphin, Louise de la Vallière, and the Duchesse de Fontanges had been attempted secretly again
       and again, whilst as for Colbert, scores of his enemies were constantly entreating for some swift
       sure poison, constantly participating in unhallowed rites which might lay low the all-powerful
       Minister. It soon came to light that Madame de Montespan and the Comtesse de Soisson (Olympe
       Mancini) were both deeply implicated, whilst the Comtesse de Rouse and Madame de Polignac in
       particular, coveting a lodging in the bed royal, had persistently sought to bring about the death of
       Louise de la Vallière. It is curious indeed to recognize the author of The Rehearsal in this train, but
       there flits in and out among the witches and anarchists a figure who can almost certainly be
       identified with George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham. Yet this is the less surprising when we
       remember how very nearly he stirred up a mutiny, if not an insurrection, against the King who had
       so particularly favoured and honoured him, but who, in the words of a contemporary, “knew him
       to be capable of the blackest designs.” Of Buckingham it has been written without exaggeration:
       “As to his personal character it is impossible to say anything in its vindication; for though his
       severest enemies acknowledge him to have possessed great vivacity and a quickness of parts
       peculiarly adapted to the purposes of ridicule, yet his warmest advocates have never attributed to
       him a single virtue. His generosity was profuseness, his wit malevolence, the gratification of his
       passions his sole aim through life.” When we consider the alliance of Buckingham with the
       infamous Shaftesbury, we need hardly wonder that whilst in Paris he frequented the haunts of this
       terrible society, and was present at, nay, even participated in the Satanic mass and other of their
       horrible mysteries. At the house of La Voisin necromancy was continually practised, poisons were
       brewed, the liturgy of hell was celebrated, and it was undoubtedly the hub of every crime and ever
       infamy. Other instances, and not a few, might be quoted from French history to show how
       intimately politics were connected with witchcraft. Here Madame de Montespan, aiming at the
       French throne, an ambition which involved the death of the Queen, Maria Theresa of Austria, at
       once resorts to black magic, and attempts to effect her purpose by aid of those who were infamous
       as past adepts in this horrid craft.
             Even in the Papal States themselves such abominations were not unknown, and in 1633 Rome
       was alarmed and confounded by an attempt upon the life of Urban VIII. It seems that some
       charlatan had announced to Giacinto Centini, nephew of the Cardinal d’Ascoli, that his uncle
       would succeed the reigning Pontiff in the Chair of S. Peter. The rash and foolish young man
       promptly attempted to hasten the event, and did not hesitate to resort to certain professors of occult
       arts to inquire when the next conclave would take place. He was so incredibly foolish that, far
       from attempting any subterfuge or disguise, he seems to have resorted to the houses of astrologers
       and other persons, who were already suspected of necromancy in the most open way, and further
       to have boasted among his intimates of the high honours which he expected his family would
       shortly enjoy. He first applied to one Fra Pietro, a Sicilian, who belonged to the Order of
       Augustinian Eremites. This occultist told him that the Cardinal d’Ascoli would be elected at the
       next conclave, but that the present Pope had many years to live. Upon seeing the young man's
       bitter disappointment the cunning mage whispered that it was in his power to bring about the event
       much sooner than it would happen in the ordinary course of affairs. Needless to say, the
       proposition was taken up with alacrity, but it was necessary to employ the services of two other
       diviners, and they accordingly selected for the task Fra Cherubino of Ancona, a Franciscan, and
       Fra Domenico of the Eremite monastery of S. Agostino at Fermo. The friars then deligently set to
       work to carry out their murderous projects. A number of ceremonies and incantations were
       performed which entailed considerable expense, and for which it was needful to procure exotic
       herbs and drugs and rare instruments of goetry that could not readily be had without attracting
       considerable curiosity. It appeared, however, as if all their charms and spells, their demoniac
       eucharists and litanies, were quite ineffective, since Urban at sixty-five years of age remained

       perfectly hale and hearty and was indeed extraordinarily active in his pontificate. Young Centini
       became manifestly impatient and spurred the wizards on to greater efforts. It really seems as if,
       vexed beyond measure and goaded to exasperation by his importunities, they flung all caution to
       the winds, whilst he himself proclaimed so magnificently what he would do for his friends in a few
       weeks or months after he had assumed the authority of Papal nephew, that it was hardly a matter of
       surprise when the Holy Office suddenly descended upon the four accomplices and brought them to
       the bar. Amongst the many charges which were put forward was one of causing “a statue of wax to
       be made of Urban VIII, in order that its dissolution might ensure that of the Pope.” This in itself
       would have been sufficiently damning, but there were many other criminal accounts all tending to
       the same end, all proven up to the hilt. The result was that Centini, Fra Pietro, and Fra Cherubino
       were executed in the Campo di Fiore, on Sunday, 22 April, 1634, whilst Fra Domenico, who was
       less desperately involved, was relegated for life to the galleys.
             These few instances I have dwelt upon in detail and at some length in order to show how
       constantly and continually in various countries and at various times witchcraft and magical
       practices were mixed up with political plots and anarchical agitation. There can be no doubt - and
       this is a fact which is so often not recognized (or it may be forgotten) that one cannot emphasize it
       too frequently - that witchcraft in its myriad aspects and myriad ramifications is a huge conspiracy
       against civilization. It was as such that the Inquisitors knew it, and it was this which gave rise to
       the extensive literature on the subject, those treatises of which the Malleus Maleficarum is perhaps
       the best known among the other writers. As early as 600 S. Gregory I had spoken in severest
       terms, enjoining the punishment of sorcerers and those who trafficked in black magic. It will be
       noted that he speaks of them as more often belonging to that class termed serui, that is to say, the
       very people from whom for the most part Nihilists and Bolsheviks have sprung in modern days.
       Writing to Januarius, Biship of Cagliari, the Pope says: “Contra idolorum cultores, uel aruspices
       atque sortilegos, fraternitatem uestram uehementius pastorali hortamur inuigilare custodia . . . et si
       quidem serui sunt, uerberibus cruciatibusque, quibus ad emendationem peruenire ualeant, castigare
       si uero sunt liberi, inclusione digna districtaque sunt in poenitentiam redigendi. . . .” But the first
       Papal ordinance directly dealing with witchcraft may not unfairly be said to be the Bull addressed
       in 1233 by Pope Gregory IX (Ugolino, Count of Segni) to the famous Conrad of Marburg, bidding
       him proceed against the Luciferians, who were overtly given over to Satanism. If this ardent
       Dominican must not strictly be considered as having introduced the Inquisition to Germany, he at
       any rate enjoyed Inquisitorial methods. Generally, perhaps, he is best known as the stern and
       unbending spiritual director of that gentle soul S. Elizabeth of Hungary. Conrad of Marburg is
       certainly a type of the strictest and most austere judge, but it should be remembered that he spared
       himself no more than he spared others, that he was swayed by no fear of persons of danger of
       death, that even if he were inflexible and perhaps fanatical, the terrible situation with which he had
       to deal demanded such a man, and he was throughout supported by the supreme authority of
       Gregory IX. That he was harsh and unlovable is, perhaps, true enough, but it is more than doubtful
       whether a man of gentler disposition could have faced the difficulties that presented themselves on
       every side. Even his most prejudiced critics have never denied the singleness of his convictions
       and his courage. He was murdered on the highway, 30 July, 1233, in the pursuit of his duties, but it
       has been well said that “it is, perhaps, significant that the Church has never set the seal of
       canonization upon his martyrdom.”
             On 13, December, 1258, Pope Alexander IV (Rinaldo Conti) issued a Bull to the Franciscan
       Inquisitors bidding them refrain from judging any cases of witchcraft unless there was some very
       strong reason to suppose that heretical practice could also be amply proved. On 10 January, 1260,
       the same Pontiff addressed a similar Bull to the Dominicans. But it is clear that by now the two
       things could not be disentangled.
             The Bull Dudum ad audientiam nostram peruenit of Boniface VIII (Benedetto Gaetani) deals
       with the charges against Walter Langton, Bishop of Conventry and Lichfield, but it may be classed
       as individual rather than general.
             Several Bulls were published by John XXII (Jacques d’Euse) and by Benedict XII (Jacques
       Fournier, O. Cist), both Avignon Popes, and these weighty documents deal with witchcraft in the
       fullest detail, anathematizing all such abominations. Gregory XI (Pierre Roger de Beaufort);
       Alexander V (Petros Filartis, a Cretan), who ruled but eleven months, from June 1409 to May
       1410; and Martin V (Ottone Colonna); each put forth one Bull on the subject. To Eugenius IV
       (Gabriello Condulmaro) we owe four Bulls which fulminate against sorcery and black magic. The
       first of these, 24 February, 1434, is addressed from Florence to the Franciscan Inquisitor, Pontius
       Fougeyron. On 1 August, 1451, the Dominican Inquisitor Hugo Niger received a Bull from
       Nicholas V (Tomaso Parentucelli). Callistus III (Alfonso de Borja) and Pius II (Enea Silvio de’
       Piccolomini) each issued one Bull denouncing the necromantic crew.
             On 9 August, 1471, the Franciscan friar, Francesco della Rovere, ascended the throne of Peter
       as Sixtus IV. His Pontificate has been severely criticized by those who forget that the Pope was a
       temporal Prince and in justice bound to defend his territory against the continual aggression of the
       Italian despots. His private life was blameless, and the stories which were circulated by such
       writers as Stefano Infessura in his Diarium are entirely without foundation. Sixtus was an eminent
       theologian, he is the author of an admirable treatise on the Immaculate Conception, and it is
       significant that he took strong measures to curb the judicial severities of Tomàs de Torquemada,
       whom he had appointed Grand Inquisitor of Castile, 11 February, 1482. During his reign he
       published three Bulls directly attacking sorcery, which he clearly identified with heresy, an
       opinion of the deepest weight when pronounced by one who had so penetrating a knowledge of the
       political currents of the day. There can be no doubt that he saw the society of witches to be nothing
       else than a vast international of anti-social revolutionaries. The first Bull is dated 17 June, 1473;
       the second 1 April. 1478; and the last 21 October, 1483.

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM

                         INTRODUCTION TO 1928 EDITION
             It has been necessarily thus briefly to review this important series of Papal documents to
       show that the famous Bull Summis desiderantes affectibus, 9 December, 1484, which Innocent
       VIII addressed to the authors of the Malleus Maleficarum, is no isolated and extraordinary
       document, but merely one in the long and important record of Papal utterances. although at the
       same time it is of the greatest importance and supremely authoritative. It has, however, been very
       frequently asserted, not only be prejudiced and unscrupulous chroniclers, but also by scholars of
       standing and repute, that this Bull of Innocent VIII, if not, as many appear to suppose, actually the
       prime cause and origin of the crusade against witches, at any rate gave the prosecution and
       energizing power and an authority which hitherto they had not, and which save for this Bull they
       could not ever have, commanded and possessed.
             It will not be impertinent then here very briefly to inquire what authority Papal Bulls may be
       considered to enjoy in general, and what weight was, and is, carried by this particular document of
       9 December, 1484.
             To enter into a history of Bulls and Briefs would require a long and elaborate monograph, so
       we must be content to remind ourselves that the term bulla, which in classical Latin meant a
       water-bubble, a bubble then came to mean a boss of metal, such as the knob upon a door. (By
       transference it also implied a certain kind of amulet, generally made of gold, which was worn upon
       the neck, especially by noble youths). Hence in course of time the word bulla indicated the leaden
       seals by which Papal (and even royal) documents were authenticated, and by an easy transition we
       recognize that towards the end of the twelfth century a Bull is the document itself. Naturally very
       many kinds of edicts are issued from the Cancellaria, but a Bull is an instrument of especial weight
       and importance, and it differs both in form and detail from constitutions, encyclicals, briefs,
       decrees, privileges, and rescripts. It should be remarked, however, that the term Bull has
       conveniently been used to denote all these, especially if they are Papal letters of any early date. By
       the fifteenth century clearer distinctions were insisted upon and maintained.
             A Bull was written in Latin and as late as the death of Pope Pius IX, 1878, the scrittura
       bollatica, an archaic and difficult type of Gothic characters much contracted and wholly
       unpunctuated was employed. This proved often well-nigh indecipherable to those who were not
       trained to the script, and accordingly there accompanied the Bull a transsumptum in an ordinary
       plain hand. The seal, appended by red and yellow (sometimes white) laces, generally bore on one
       side the figures of SS. Peter and Paul; on the other a medallion or the name of the reigning Pontiff.
             A Bull begins thus: “N. Episcopus Seruus seruorum Dei ad perpetuam rei memoriam.” It is
       dated “Anno incarnationis Domini,” and also “Pontificatus Nostri anno primo (uel secundom,
       tertio, etc.).” Those Bulls which set forth and define some particular statement will be found to add
       certain minatory clauses directed against those who obstinately refuse to accept the Papal decision.
             It should be remembered that, as has already been said, the famous Bull of Pope Innocent
       VIII is only one in a long line of Apostolic Letters dealing with the subject of witchcraft.
             On 18 June, 1485, the Pontiff again recommended the two Inquisitors to Berthold,
       Archbishop of Mainz, in a Bull Pro causa fidei; upon the same date a similar Bull was sent to the
       Archduke Sigismund, and a Brief to Abbot John of Wingarten, who is highly praised for his
       devotion and zeal. On 30 September, 1486, a Bull addressed to the Bishop of Brescia and to
       Antonio di Brescia, O.P., Inquisitor for Lombardy, emphasizes the close connexion, nay, the
       identity of witchcraft with heresy.
             Alexander VI published two Bulls upon the same theme, and in a Bull of Julius II there is a
       solemn description of that abomination the Black Mass, which is perhaps the central feature of the
       worship of Satanists, and which is unhappily yet celebrated to-day in Londin, in Paris, in Berlin,
       and in many another great city.
             Leo X, the great Pope of Humanism, issued on Bull on the subject; but even more important
       is the Bull Dudum uti nobis exponi fecisti, 20 July, 1523, which speaks of the horrible abuse of the
       Sacrament in sorceries and the charms confuted by witches.
             We have two briefs of Clement VII; and on 5 January, 1586, was published that long and
       weighty Constitution of Sixtus V, Coeli et Terrae Creator Deus, which denounces all those who
       are devoted to Judicial Astrology and kindred arts that are envenomed with black magic and
       goetry. There is a Constitution of Gregory XV, Omnipotentis Dei, 20 March, 1623; and a
       Constitution of Urban VIII, Inscrutabilis iudiciorum Dei altitudo, 1 April, 1631, which - if we
       except the recent condemnation of Spiritism in the nineteenth century - may be said to be the last
       Apostolic document directed against these foul and devilish practices.
             We may now consider the exact force of the Apostolic Bull Summis desiderantes affectibus
       issed on 9 December, 1484, by Innocent VIII to Fr. Henry Kramer and Fr. James Sprenger.
             In the first place, it is superflous to say that no Bull would have been published without the
       utmost deliberation, long considering of phrases, and above all earnest prayer. This document of
       Pope Innocent commences with the set grave formula of a Bull of the greatest weight and
       solemnity. “Innocentius Episcopus Seruus seruorum Dei ad perpetuam rei memoriam.” It draws to
       its conclusion with no brief and succinct prohibitory clauses but with a solemn measured period:
       “Non obstantibus praemissis ac constitutionibus et ordinationibus Apostolicis contrariis
       quibuscunque. . . .” The noble and momentous sentences are built up word by word, beat by beat,
       ever growing more and more authoritative, more and more judicial, until they culminate in the
       minatory and imprecatory clauses which are so impressive, so definite, that no loophole is left for
       escape, no turn for evasion. “Nulli ergo omnino hominum liceat hanc paganim nostrae
       declarationis extentionis concessionis et mandati infringere uel ei ausu temeraris contrarie Si qui
       autem attentate praesumpserit indignationem omnipotentis Dei ac beatorum Petri et Pauli
       Apostolorum eius se nouerit incursurum.” If any man shall presume to go against the tenor let him
       know that therein he will bring down upon himself the wrath of Almighty God and of the Blessed
       Apostles Peter and Paul.
             Could words weightier be found?
             Are we then to class this Bull with the Bulla dogmatica Ineffabilis Deus wherein Pope Pius
       IX proclaimed the dogma of the Immaculate Conception? Such a position is clearly tenable, but
       even if we do not insist that the Bull of Innocent VIII is an infallible utterance, since the Summis
       desiderantes affectibus does not in set terms define a dogma although it does set forth sure and
       certain truths, it must at the very least be held to be a document of supreme and absolute authority,
       of dogmatic force. It belongs to that class of ex cathedra utterances “for which infallibility is

       claimed on the ground, not indeed of the terms of the Vatican definition, but of the constant
       practice of the Holy See, the consentient teaching of the theologians, as well as the clearest
       deductions of the principles of faith.” Accordingly the opinion of a person who rashly impugns
       this Bull is manifestly to be gravely censures as erronea, sapiens haeresim, captiosa, subuersiua
       hierarchiae; erroneous, savouring of heresy, captious, subversive of the hierarchy.
             Without exception non-Catholic historians have either in no measured language denounced or
       else with sorrow deplored the Bull of Innocent VIII as a most pernicious and unhappy document, a
       perpetual and irrevocable manifesto of the unchanged and unchangeable mind of the Papacy. From
       this point of view they are entirely justified, and their attitude is undeniably logical and right. The
       Summis desideranted affectibus is either a dogmatic exposition by Christ's Vicar upon earth or it is
       altogether abominable.
             Hansen, either in honest error or of intent, willfully misleads when he writes, “it is perfectly
       obvious that the Bull pronounces no dogmatic decision.” As has been pointed out, in one very
       narrow and technical sense this may be correct - yet even here the opposite is arguable and
       probably true - but such a statement thrown forth without qualification is calculated to create, and
       undoubtedly does create, an entirely false impression. It is all the more amazing to find that the
       writer of the article upon “Witchcraft” in the Catholic Encyclopaedia quotes Hansen with
       complete approval and gleefully adds with regard to the Bull of Innocent VIII, “neither does the
       form suggest that the Pope wishes to bind anyone to believe more about the reality of witchcraft
       than is involved in the utterances of Holy Scripture,” a statement which is essentially Protestant in
       its nature, and, as is acknowledged by every historian of whatsoever colour or creed, entirely
       untrue. By its appearance in a standard work of reference, which is on the shelves of every library,
       this article upon “Witchcraft” acquires a certain title to consideration which upon its merits it
       might otherwise lack. It is signed Herbert Thurston, and turning to the list of “Contributors to the
       Fifteenth Volume” we duly see “Thurston, Herbert, S.J., London.” Since a Jesuit Father
       emphasizes in a well-known (and presumably authoritative) Catholic work an opinion so
       derogatory to the Holy See and so definitely opposed to all historians, one is entitled to express
       curiosity concerning other writings which may not have come from his pen. I find that for a
       considerable number of years Fr. Thurston has been contributing to The Month a series of articles
       upon mystical phenomena and upon various aspects of mysticism, such as the Incorruption of the
       bodies of Saints and Beati, the Stigmata, the Prophecies of holy persons, the miracles of Crucifixes
       that bleed or pictures of the Madonna which move, famous Sanctuaries, the inner life of and
       wonderful events connected with persons still living who have acquired a reputation for sanctity.
       This busy writer directly or incidentally has dealt with that famous ecstatica Anne Catherine
       Emmerich; the Crucifix of Limpias; Our Lady of Campocavallo; S. Januarus; the Ven. Maria
       d’Agreda; Gemma Galgani; Padre Pio Pietralcina; that gentle soul Teresa Higginson, the beauty of
       whose life has attracted thousands, but whom Fr. Thurston considers hysterical and masochistic
       and whose devotions to him savour of the “snowball” prayer; Pope Alexander VI; the origin of the
       Rosary; the Carmelite scapular; and very many themes beside. Here was have a mass of material,
       and even a casual glance through these pages will suffice to show the ugly prejudice which
       informs the whole. The intimate discussions on miracles, spiritual graces and physical phenomena,
       which above all require faith, reverence, sympathy, tact and understanding, are conducted with a
       roughness and a rudeness infinitely regrettable. What is worse, in every case Catholic tradition and
       loyal Catholic feeling are thrust to one side; the note of scepticism, of modernism, and even of
       rationalism is arrogantly dominant. Tender miracles of healing wrought at some old sanctuary, the
       records of some hidden life of holiness secretly lived amongst us in the cloister or the home, these
       things seem to provoke Fr. Thurston to such a pitch of annoyance that he cannot refrain from
       venting his utmost spleen. The obsession is certainly morbid. It is reasonable to suppose that a
       lengthy series of papers all concentrating upon certain aspects of mysticism would have collected
       in one volume, and it is extremely significant that in the autumn of 1923 a leading house
       announced among Forthcoming Books: “The Physical Phenomena of Mysticism. By the Rev.
       Herbert Thurston, S.J.” Although in active preparation, this has never seen the light. I have heard
       upon good authority that the ecclesiastical superiors took exception to such a publication. I may, of
       course, be wrong, and there can be no question that there is room for a different point of view, but
       I cannot divest my mind of the idea that the exaggerated rationalization of mystical phenomena
       conspicuous in the series of articles I have just considered may be by no means unwelcome to the
       Father of Lies. It really plays into his hands: first, because it makes the Church ridiculous by
       creating the impression that her mystics, particularly friars and nuns, are for the most part sickly
       hysterical subjects, deceivers and deceived, who would be fit inmates of Bedlam; that many of her
       most reverend shrines, Limpias, Campocavallo, and the sanctuaries of Naples, are frauds and
       conscious imposture; and, secondly, because it condemns and brings into ridicule that note of
       holiness which theologians declare is one of the distinctive marks of the true Church.
            There is also evil speaking of dignities. In 1924 the Right Rev. Mgr. Oeter de Roo published
       an historical work in five volumes, Materials for a History of Pope Alexander VI, his Relatives
       and his Time, wherein he demonstrates his thesis that Pope Alexander VI was “a man of good
       moral character and an excellent Pope.” This is quite enough for Fr. Thurston to assail him in the
       most vulgar and ill-bred way. The historian is a “crank,” “constitutionally incapable,”
       “extravagant,” and one who writes in “queer English,” and by rehabilitating Alexander VI has
       “wasted a good deal of his own time.” “One would be loath to charge him with deliberate
       suggestio falis,” smugly remarks Fr. Thurston, and of course directly conveys that impression. As
       to Pope Alexander, the most odious charges are one more hurled against the maligned Pontiff, and
       Fr. Thurston for fifteen nauseating pages insists upon “the evil example of his private life.” This is
       unnecessary; it is untrue; it shows contempt of Christ's Vicar on earth.

        November, 1896, the Pope declared that his intention has been absolute iudicare et penitus

              The most disquieting of all Fr. Thurston's writings that I know is without doubt his article
       upon the Holy House of Loreto, which is to be found in the Catholic Encyclopaedia, Vol. XIII, pp.
       454-56, “Santa Casa di Loreto.” Here he jubilantly proclaims that “the Lauretan tradition is beset
       with difficulties of the gravest kind. These have been skilfully presented in the much-discussed
       work of Canon Chevalier, ‘Notre Dame de Lorette’ (Paris, 1906). . . . His argument remains intact
       and has as yet found no adequate reply.” This last assertion is simply incorrect, as Canon U.
       Chevalier's theories have been answered and demolished both by Father A. Eschbach,
       Procurator-General of the Congregation of the Holy Ghost, in his exhaustive work La Vérité sur le
       Fair de Lorette, and by the Rev. G. E. Phillips in his excellent study Loreto and the Holy House.
       From a careful reading of the article “Santa Casa di Loreto” it is obvious that the writer does not
       accept the fact of the Translation of the Holy House; at least that is the only impression I can
       gather from his words as, ignoring an unbroken tradition, the pronouncements of more than fifty
       Popes, the devotion of innumerable saints, the piety of countless writers, he gratuitously piles
       argument upon argument and emphasizes objection after objection to reduce the Translation of the
       House of Nazareth from Palestine to Italy to the vague story of a picture of the Madonna brought
       from Tersato in Illyria to Loreto. With reference to Canon Chevalier's work, so highly applauded
       by Fr. Thurston, it is well known that the late saintly Pontiff Pius X openly showed his great
       displeasure at the book, and took care to let it be widely understood that such an attack upon the
       Holy House sorely vexed and grieved him. In a Decree, 12 April, 1916, Benedict XV, ordering the
       Feast of the Translation of the Holy House to be henceforward observed every year on the 10th
       December, in all the Dioceses and Religious Congregations of Italy and the adjacent Isles,
       solemnly and decisively declares that the Sanctuary of Loreto is “the House itself - translated from
       Palestine by the ministry of Angels - in which was born the Blessed Virgin Mary, and in which the
       Word was made Flesh.” In the face of this pronouncement it is hard to see how any Catholic can
       regard the Translation of the Holy House as a mere fairy tale to be classed with Jack and the
       Beanstalk or Hop o’ my Thumb. It is certain that Fr. Thurston's disedifying attack has given pain to
       thousands of pious souls, and in Italy I have heard an eminent theologian, an Archbishop, speak of
       these articles in terms of unsparing condemnation.
              Father Thurston is the author of a paper upon the subject of Pope Joan, but I am informed that
       it is no longer in print, and as I have not thought it worth while to make acquaintance with this
       lucubration I am unable to say whether he accepts the legend of this mythical dame as true or no.
              His bias evidently makes him incapable of dealing impartially with any historical fact, and
       even a sound and generally accepted theory would gain nothing by the adherence of so prejudiced
       an advocate. It has seemed worth while to utter a word of caution regarding his extraordinary
       output, and especially in our present connexion with reference to the article upon “Witchcraft,”
       which appears to me so little qualified to furnish the guidance readers may require in this difficult
       subject, and which by its inclusion in a standard work of reference might be deemed trustworthy
       and reliable.
             It is very certain then that the Bull of Innocent VIII, Summis desiderantes affectibus, was at
       least a document of the highest authority, and that the Pontiff herein clearly intended to set forth
       dogmatic facts, although this can be distinguished from the defining of a dogma. A dogmatic fact
       is not indeed a doctrine of revelation, but it is so intimately connected with a revealed doctrine that
       it would be impossible to deny the dogmatic fact without contradicting or seriously impugning the
       dogma. It would not be very difficult to show that any denial of the teaching of Pope Innocent VIII
       must traverse the Gospel accounts of demoniacs, the casting out of devils by Our Saviour, and His
       Divine words upon the activities of evil spirits.
             Giovanni Battista Cibò, the son of Arano Cibò and Teodorina de’ Mare, was born at Genoa in
       1432. His father, a high favourite with Callistus III (Alfonso de Borja), who reigned from 8 April,
       1455, to 6 August, 1458, had filled with distinction the senatorial office at Rome in 1455, and
       under King René won great honour as Viceroy of Naples. Having entered the household of
       Cardinal Calandrini, Giovanni Battista Cibò was in 1467 created Bisop of Savona by Paul II, in
       1473 Bishop of Molfetta by Sixtus IV, who raised him to the cardinalate in the following year. In
       the conclave which followed the death of this Pontiff, his great supporter proved to be Guiliano
       della Rovere, and on 29 August, 1484, he ascended the Chair of S. Peter, taking the name of
       Innocent VIII in memory, it is said, of his countryman, the Genoese Innocent IV (Sinibaldo de’
       Fieschi), who reigned from 25 June, 1243, to 7 December, 1254. The new Pope had to deal with a
       most difficult political situation, and before long found himself involved in a conflict with Naples.
       Innocent VIII made the most earnest endeavours to unite Christendom against the common enemy,
       the Turk, but the unhappy indecision among various princes unfortunately precluded any definite
       result, although the Rhodians surrendered to the Holy Father. As for Djem, the younger son of
       Mohammad II, this prince had fled for protection to the Knights of S. John, and Sultan Bajazet
       pledged himself to pay an annual allowance of 35,000 ducats for the safe-keeping of his brother.
       The Grand Master handed over Djem to the Pope and on 13 March, 1489, the Ottoman entered
       Rome, where he was treated with signal respect and assigned apartments in the Vatican itself.
             Innocent VIII only canonized one Saint, the Margrave Leopold of Austria, who was raised to
       the Altar 6 January, 1485. However, on 31 May, 1492, he received from Sultan Bajazet the
       precious Relic of the Most Holy Lance with which Our Redeemer had been wounded by S.
       Longinus upon the Cross. A Turkish emir brought the Relic to Ancona, whence it was conveyed
       by the Bishop to Narni, when two Cardinals took charge of it and carried it to Rome. On 31 May
       Cardinal Hiulino della Rovere solemnly handed it in a crystal vessel to the Pope during a function
       at S. Maria del Popolo. It was then borne in procession to S. Peter's, and from the loggia of the
       protico the Holy Father bestowed his blessing upon the crowds, whilst the Cardinal della Rovere
       standing at his side exposed the Sacred Relic to the veneration of the thronging piazza. The Holy
       Lance, which is accounted one of the three great Relics of the Passion, is shown together with the
       Piece of the True Cross and S. Veronica's Veil at S. Peter's after Matins on Spy Wednesday and on
       Good Friday evening; after High Mass on Easter Day, and also several times during the course of
       Maundy Thursday and Good Friday. The Relics are exposed from the balcony over the statue of S.
       Veronica to the left of the Papal Altar. The strepitaculum is sounded from the balcony and then all
       present venerate the Lance, the Wood of the Cross, and the Volto Santo.
             One of the most important exterior events which marked the reign of Innocent was
       undoubtedly the fall of Granada, the last stronghold of the Moors in Spain, which city surrendered

       to Ferdinand of Aragon, who thereby with his Queen Isabella won the name of “Catholic,” on 2
       January, 1492. The conquest of Granada was celebrated with public rejoicings and the most
       splendid fêtes at Rome. Every house was brilliant with candles; the expulsion of the
       Mohammedans was represented upon open stages in a kind of pantomime; and long processions
       visited the national church of Spain in the Piazza Navona, San Giacomo degli Spagnuoli, which
       had been erected in 1450.
             On 25 July, 1492, Pope Innocent, who had long been sickly and ailing so that his only
       nourishment for many weeks was woman's milk, passed away in his sleep at the Vatican. They
       buried him in S. Peter's, this great and noble Pontiff, and upon his tomb, a work in bronze by
       Pollaiuolo, were inscribed the felicitous words: Ego autem in Innocentia mea ingressus sum.
             The chroniclers or rather scandalmongers of the day, Burchard and Infessura, have done their
       best to draw the character of Innocent VIII in very black and shameful colours, and it is to be
       regretted that more than one historian has not only taken his cure from their odious insinuations
       and evil gossip, but yet further elaborated the story by his own lurid imagination. When we add
       thereto and retail as sober evidence the venom of contemporary satirists such as Marullo and the
       fertile exaggerations of melodramatic publicists such as Egidio of Viterbo, a very sensational
       grotesque is the result. During his youth Giovanni Battista Cibò had, it seems, become enamoured
       of a Neapolitan lady, by whom he was the father of two children, Franceschetto and Teodorina. As
       was proper, both son and daughter were provided for in an ample and munificent manner; in 1488
       his father married Franceschetto to Maddalena, a daughter of Lorenzo de’ Medici. The lady
       Teodorina became the bride of Messer Gherardo Uso de’ Mare, a Genoese merchant of great
       wealth, who was also Papal Treasurer. The capital that has been made out of these circumstances is
       hardly to be believed. It is admitted that this is contrary to strict morality and to be reasonably
       blamed. But this intrigue has been taken as the grounds for accusations of the most unbridled
       licentiousness, the tale of a lewd and lustful life. So far as I am aware the only other evidence for
       anything of the kind is the mud thrown by obscure writers at a great and truly Christian, if not
       wholly blameless, successor of S. Peter.
             In spite of these few faults Innocent VIII was a Pontiff who at a most difficult time worthily
       filled his Apostolic dignity. In his public office his constant endeavours for peace; his tireless
       efforts to unite Christendom against their common foe, the Turk; his opposition to the
       revolutionary Hussites in Bohemia and the anarchical Waldenses, two sources of the gravest
       danger, must be esteemed as worthy of the highest praise. Could he have brought his labours to
       fruition Europe would in later ages have been spared many a conflict and many a disaster.
             Roscoe in reference to Innocent remarks: “The urbanity and mildness of his manners formed
       a striking contrast to the inflexible character of his predecessor.” And again: “If the character of
       Innocent were to be impartially weighed, the balance would incline, but with no very rapid motion,
       to the favourable side. His native disposition seems to have been mild and placable; but the
       disputed claims of the Roman See, which he conceived it to be his duty to enforce, led him into
       embarassments, from which he was with difficulty extricated, and which, without increasing his
       reputation, destroyed his repose.” We have here the judgement of a historian who is inclined to
       censure rather than to defend, and who certainly did not recognize, because he was incapable of
       appreciating, the almost overwhelming difficulties with which Innocent must needs contend if he
       were, as in conscience bound, to act as the chief Pastor of Christendom, a critical position which
       he needs must face and endeavour to control, although he were well aware that humanly speaking

       his efforts had no chance of success, whilst they cost him health and repose and gained him
       oppugnancy and misunderstanding.
             Immediately upon the receipt of the Bull, Summis desiderantes affectibus, in 1485, Fr. Henry
       Kramer commenced his crusade against witches at Innsbruck, but he was opposed on certain
       technical grounds by the Bishop of Brixen, nor was Duke Sigismund so ready to help the
       Inquisitors with the civil arm. In fact the prosecutions were, if not actually directed, at least largely
       controlled, by the episcopal authority; nor did the ordinary courts, as is so often supposed,
       invariably carry out the full sentence of the Holy Office. Not so very many years later, indeed, the
       civil power took full cognizance of any charges of witchcraft, and it was then that far more blood
       was spilled and far more fires blazed than ever in the days when Kramer and Sprenger were
       directing the trials. It should be borne in mind too that frequent disturbances, conspiracies of
       anarchists, and nascent Bolshevism showed that the district was rotted to the core, and the
       severities of Kramer and Sprenger were by no means so unwarranted as is generally supposed.
             On 6 June, 1474, Sprenger (Mag. Jacobus Sprenger) is mentioned as Prior of the Dominican
       house at Cologne, and on 8 February, 1479, he was present, as the socius of Gerhard von Elten, at
       the trial of John von Ruchratt of Wesel, who was found guilty of propagating the most subversive
       doctrines, and was sentenced to seclusion in the Augustinian monastery at Mainz, where he died in
       1481.
             Unfortunately full biographies of these two remarkable men, James Sprenger and Henry
       Kramer, have not been transmitted to us, but as many details have been succinctly collected in the
       Scriptores Ordinis Praedicatorum of Quétif and Echard, Paris, 1719, I have thought it convenient
       to transcribe the following accounts from that monumental work.
             F. Jacobus Sprenger (sub anno 1494). Fr. James Sprenger, a German by birth and a member
       of the community of the Dominican house at Cologne, greatly distinguished himself in his
       academic career at the University of that city. His name was widely known in the year 1468, when
       at the Chapter General of the Order which was held at Rome he was appointed Regent of Studies
       at the Formal House of Studies at Cologne, and the following is recorded in the statutes: Fr. James
       Sprenger is officially appointed to study and lecture upon the Sentences so that he may proceed to
       the degree of Master. A few years later, although he was yet quite a young man, since he had
       already proceeded Master, he was elected Prior and Regent of this same house, which important
       offices he held in the year 1475, and a little after, we are told, he was elected Provincial of the
       whole German Province. It was about this date that he was named by Sixtus IV General Inquisitor
       for Germany, and especially for the dioceses of Cologne and Mainz. He coadjutor was a Master of
       Sacred Theology, of the Cologne Convent, by name Fr. Gerard von Elten, who unfortunately died
       within a year or two. Pope Innocent VIII confirmed Fr. Sprenger in this office, and appointed Fr.
       Henry Kramer as his socius. Fr. Sprenger was especially distinguished on account of his burning
       and fearless zeal for the old faith, his vigilance, his constancy, his singleness and patience in
       correcting novel abuses and errors. We know that he was living in our house at Cologne at least as
       late as the year 1494, since the famous Benedictine Abbot John Trithemus refers to him in this
       year. It is most probable that he died and was buried among his brethren at Cologne. The following
       works are the fruit of his pen:
                                                                   Page 6 of 8

           1917. There are, it should be remarked, many other writers of authority who conclusively
        traverse Canon Chevalier's thesis, but these are dismissed by Fr. Thurston as “comparatively few
        and unimportant.” One would be loath to charge him with deliberate suggestio falsi.

            On the second Friday in Lent was formerly kept the Feast of the Spear and Nails first granted
        by Innocent VI, 13 February, 1353, for Germany and Bohemia at the request of Charles IV. In
        some places the Feast was kept on the Friday after Low Sunday. It is now observed by certain
        religious families.

           Burchard was only aware of two children of Innocent VIII. But Egidio of Viterbo wrote:
        “Primus pontificum filios filiasque palam ostentauit, primus eorum apertas fecit nuptias.” And
        there are the Epigrams of Marullo:
           Quid quaeris testes, sit mas an foemina Cibo?
            Respice natorum, pignora certa, gregem.

           In November, 1485, the Bishop required Fr. Kramer to leave the diocese of Brixen. At the
        beginning of Lent, 1486, the Bishop insists that Fr. Kramer shall no longer delay his departure.



           Born at Trittenheim on the Moselle, 1 February, 1462; died at Wülrzburg, 13 December, 1518.
        He took the monastic habit in 1482 at Sponheim, and here, owing to his love of books, he built up
        the renowned library. Having ruled as abbot for twenty-three years he sought a more retired and
        peaceful life, which he enjoyed as head of the Scottish house of S. James at Wülrzburg. Here he
        died aged fifty-five years. Only a part of his works, numbering more than eighty, have appeared in
        print. Many treat of the ascetical life, but some deal with classical literature and natural science.

                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM

                         INTRODUCTION TO 1928 EDITION
             1. The Paradoxes of John of Westphalia, which he preached from the pulpit at Worms,
       disproved and utterly refuted by two Masters of Sacred Theology, Fr. Gerard von Elten of Cologne
       and Fr. James Sprenger. Printed at Mainz, 1479.
             2. Malleus Maleficarum Maleficat & earum haeresim, ut framea potentissima conterens per
       F. Henricum Institoris & Jacobum Sprengerum Ord. Praedic. Inquisitores, which has run into
       many editions (see the notice of Fr. Henry Kramer). This book was translated into French as Le
       Maillet des Sorcières, Lyons, Stephanus Gueynard, 4to. See the Bibliothèque Françoise du
       Verdier.
             3. The institution and approbation of the Society of Confraternity of the Most Holy Rosary
       which was first erected at Cologne on 8 September in the year 1475, with an account of many
       graces and Miracles, as also of the indulgences which have been granted to this said
       Confraternity. I am uncertain whether he wrote and issued this book in Latin or in German, since I
       have never seen it, and it was certainly composed for the instruction and edification of the people.
       Moreover, it is reported that the following circumstances were the occasion of the found of this
       Society. In the year 1475, when Nuess was being besieged by Charles, Duke of Burgunday, with a
       vast army, and the town was on the very point of surrender, the magistrates and chief burghers of
       Cologne, fearing the danger which threatened their city, resorted in a body to Fr. James, who was
       then Prior of the Convent, and besought him that if he knew of any plan or device which might
       haply ward off this disaster, he would inform them of it and instruct them what was best to be
       done. Fr. James, having seriously debated the matter with the senior members of the house, replied
       that all were agreed there could be no more unfailing and present remedy than to fly to the help of
       the Blessed Virgin, and that the very best way of effecting this would be if they were not only to
       honour the Immaculate Mother of God by means of the Holy Rosary which had been propagated
       several years ago by Blessed Alan de la Roche, but that they should also institute and erect a
       Society and Confraternity, in which every man should enrol himself with the firm resolve of
       thenceforth zealously and exactly fulfilling with a devout mind the obligations that might be
       required by the rules of membership. This excellent plan recommended itself to all. On the feast of
       the Nativity of Our Lady (8 September) the Society was inaugurated and High Mass was sung;
       there was a solemn procession throughout the city; all enrolled themselves and were inscribed on
       the Register; they fulfilled their duties continually with the utmost fervor, and before long the
       reward of their devotion was granted to them, since peace was made between the Emperor
       Frederick IV and Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgandy. In the following year, 1476, Alexander
       Nanni de Maltesta, Bishop of Forli and legatus a latere from Sixtus IV, who was then residing at
       Cologne, solemnly approved the Confraternity and on 10 March enriched it with many
       indulgences. And this is the first of those societies which are known as the Rosary Confraternirty
       to be erected and approved by the Apostolic authority. For in a short time, being enriched with so
       many indulgences, and new privileges and benefice being bestowed upon them almost daily, they
       have spread everywhere and they are to be found in almost every town and city throughout the
       whole of Christendom. It is worthy of remark that on the very same day that this Confraternity was
       erected at Cologne, Blessed Alan de la Roche of blessed memory, the most eminent promoter of
       the devotion of the Holy Rosary, died at Rostock; and his beloved disciple, Fr. Michel François de
       l’Isle, who was sometime Master of Sacred Theology at Cologne, gave Fr. Sprenger the most
       valuable assistance when the Rosary was being established, as we have related above. The works
       of Fr. James Sprenger are well approved by many authors as well as Trithemius; since amongst
       others who have praised him highly we may mention Albert Leander, O.P.; Antony of Siena, O.P.;
       Fernandez in his Concert. & Isto. del Rosar, Lib. 4, cap. 1, fol. 127; Fontana in his Theatro &
       Monum. published at Altamura, 1481; and, of authors not belonging to our Order, Antonius
       Possevinus, S.J., Miraeus, Aegidius Gelenius in his De admirance Coloniae Agrippinae urbi
       Ubiorum Augustae magnitudine sacra & ciuli, Coloniae, 1645, 4to, p. 430; Dupin, and very many
       more.
             Of Henry Kramer, Jacques Quétif and Echard, Scriptores Ordini Praedicatorum, Paris, 1719,
       Vol. 1, pp. 896-97, sub anno 1500, give the following account: Fr. Henry Kramer (F. Henricus
       Institorus) was of German nationality and a member of the German Province. It is definitely
       certain the he was a Master of Sacred Theology, which holy science he publicly professed,
       although we have not been able to discover either in what town of Germany he was born, in what
       Universities he lectured, or in what house of the Order he was professed. He was, however, very
       greatly distinguished by he zeal for the Faith, which he most bravely and most strenuously
       defended both by his eloquence in the pulpit and on the printed page, and so when in those dark
       days various errors had begun to penetrate Germany, and witches with their horrid craft, foul
       sorceries, and devilish commerce were increasing on every side, Pope Innocent VIII, by Letters
       Apostolic which were given at Rome at S. Peter's in the first year of his reign, 1484, appointed
       Henry Kramer and James Sprenger, Professors of Sacred Theology, general Inquisitors for all the
       dioceses of the five metropolitan churches of Germany, that is to say, Mainz, Cologne, Trèves,
       Salzburg, and Bremen. They showed themselves most zealous in the work which they had to do,
       and especially did they make inquisition for witches and for those who were gravely suspect of
       sorcery, all of whom they prosecuted with the extremest rigour of the law. Maximilian I, Emperor
       of Germany and King of the Romans, by royal letters patent which he signed at Brussels on 6
       November, 1486, bestowed upon Fr. Kramer and Fr. Sprenger the enjoyment of full civil powers
       in the performance of their duties as Inquisitors, and he commanded that throughout his dominions
       all should obey the two delegates of the Holy Office in their business, and should be ready and
       willing to help them upon every occasion. For several years Fr. Henry Kramer was Spiritual
       Director attached to our Church at Salzburg, which important office he fulfilled with singular great
       commendation. Thence he was summoned in the year 1495 to Venice by the Master-General of the
       Order, Fr. Joaquin de Torres, in order that he might give public lectures, and hold disputations
       concerning public worship and the adoration of the Most Holy Sacrament. For there were some
       theologians about this date who taught that the Blessed Sacrament must only be worshipped
       conditionally, with an implicit and intellectual reservation of adoring the Host in the tabernacle
       only in so far as It had been duly and exactly consecrated. Fr. Kramer, whose disputations were
       honoured by the presence of the Patriarch of Venice, with the utmost fervour publicly confronted
       those who maintained this view, and not infrequently did he preach against them from the pulpit.
       The whole question had recently arisen from a certain circumstance which happened in the vicinity
       of Padua. When a country fellow was collecting wood and dry leaves in a little copse hard by the
       city he found, wrapped up in a linen cloth beneath some dry brambles and bracken and dead
       branches of trees, two pyxes or ciboria containing particles which some three years before had
       been stolen from a neighbouring church, the one of which was used to carry the Lord's Body to the
       sick, the other being provided for the exposition of the Sanctissimum on the feast of Corpus
       Christi. The rustic immediately reported what he had discovered to the parish priest of the chapel
       hard by the spinnery. The good Father immediately hastened to the spot and saw that it was
       exactly as had been told him. When he more closely examined the vessels he found in one pyx a
       number of Hosts, and so fetching thither from the church a consecrated altar-stone which it was the
       custom to carry when the Viaticum was taken to the dying in order that the ciborium might be
       decently set thereon, he covered the stone with a corporal or a friar linen cloth and reverently
       placed it beneath the pyx. He built all around a little wooden baldaquin or shrine, and presently put
       devout persons to watch the place so that no indignity might be done. Meanwhile the incident had
       been noised abroad and vast throngs of people made their way to the place where the thicket was;
       candles were lighted all around; “Christ's Body,” they cry, “is here”; and every knee bent in
       humblest adoration. Before long news of the event was reported to the Bishop of Padua, who,
       having sent thither tow or three priests, inquired most carefully into every detail. Since in the other
       ciborium they only found some corrupted particles of the Sacramental Species, in the sight of the
       whole multitude the clerics who had come from the Bishop broke down the tiny tabernacle that
       had been improvised, scattered all the boughs and leafery which were arranged about it,
       extinguished the tapers, and carried the sacred vessels away with them. Immediately after it was
       forbidden under severest penalties of ecclesiastical censures and excommunication itself for
       anyone to visit that spot or to offer devotions there. Moreover, upon this occasion certain priests
       preached openly that the people who resorted thither had committed idolatry, that they had
       worshipped nothing else save brambles and decay, trees, nay, some went so far as to declare that
       they had adored the devil himself. As might be supposed, very grave contentions were set astir
       between the parish priests and their flocks, and it was sharply argued whether the people had
       sinned by their devotion to Christ's Body, Which they sincerely believed to be there, but Which (it
       seems) perhaps was not there: and the question was then mooted whether a man ought not to
       worship the Blessed Sacrament, ay, even when Christ's Body is consecrated in the Holy Sacrifice
       of the Mass and elevated and carried as Viaticum in procession to the sick, only conditionally, that
       is to say, since he does not perhaps know if It is actually Christ's Body (or whether some accident
       may not have occurred), since no mane can claim to be individually enlightened to by God on this
       point and desire to have the Mystery demonstrated and proved to him. It was much about the same
       thing that Fr. Kramer undertook to refute and utterly disprove the bold and wicked theories put
       forward by another preacher who at Augsburg dared to proclaim from the pulpit that the Catholic
       Church had not definitely laid down that the appearances of Christ in His human body, and
       sometimes bleeding from His Sacred Wounds, in the Blessed Sacrament are real and true
       manifestations of Our Saviour, but that it may be disputed whether Our Lord is truly there and
       truly to be worshipped by the people. This wretch even went so far as to say that miracles of this
       kind should be left as it were to the good judgement of God, inasmuch as with regard to these
       miraculous appearances nothing had been strictly defined by the Church, nor yet do the Holy
       Fathers or Doctors lay down and sure and certain rule. These doctrines Fr. Kramer opposed with
       the utmost zeal and learning, delivering many an eloquent sermon against the innovator and utterly

       condemning the theories which had been thus put forth and proclaimed. Nay, more, by virtue of
       his position and his powers as delegate of the Holy Office he forbade under the pain of
       excommunication that anyone should ever again dare to preach such errors. Fr. Kramer wrote
       several works, of which some have been more than once reprinted:
            1. Malleus Maleficarum Maleficas & earum haeresim, ut framea potentissima conterens per
       F. Henricum Institorem & Jacobum Sprengerem ord. Praed. Inquisitores, Lyons, Junta, 1484. This
       edition is highly praised by Fontana in his work De Monumentis. Another edition was published at
       Paris, apud Joannem Paruum, 8vo; also at Cologne, apud Joanem Gymnicium, 8vo, 1520; and
       another edition apud Nicolaum Bassaeum at Frankfort, 8vo, 1580 and 1582 (also two vols., 12mo,
       1588). The editions of 1520, 1580, and 1582 are to be found in the Royal Library, Nos. 2882,
       2883, and 2884. The editions printed at Venice in 1576 and at Lyons in 1620 are highly praised by
       Dupin. The latest edition is published at Lyons, Sumptibus Claudi Bourgeat, 4 vols., 1669. The
       Malleus Maleficarum, when submitted by the authors to the University of Cologne was officially
       approved by all the Doctors of the Theological Faculty on 9 May, 1487.
            2. Several Discourses and various sermons against the four errors which have newly arisen
       with regard to the Most Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, now collected and brought together by
       the Professor of Scripture of the Church of Salzburg, Brother Henry Kramer, of the Order of
       Preachers, General Inquisitor of heretical pravity. Published at Nuremburg by Antony Joberger,
       4to, 1496. This work is divided into three parts:
              The First Part. A Tractate against the errors of the preacher who taught that Christ was only
              to be conditionally worshipped in the Blessed Sacrament: A Reply to the objection raised by
              this preacher, and XI sermons on the Blessed Sacrament.
              The Second Part. XIX Sermons on the Blessed Sacrament.
              The Third Part.
                  1. Further Six Sermons on the Sacrament.
                  2. Advice and cautels for priests.
                  3. A little Treatise concerning the miraculous Host and the species of Blood which have
                     been reserved for the space of 300 years at Augsburg, or a sharp confutation of the
                     error which asserts that the miraculous Sacrament if the Eucharist, whilst there is the
                     appearance in the Host of Blood or Human Flesh or the form of a Figure, is not truly
                     the Blessed Sacrament, with the promulgation of the Ban of Excommunication against
                     all and sundry who dare to entertain this opinion. A copy of this book may be found
                     at Paris in the library of our monastery of S. Honorat.

             In was about the same time, 1497-98, that certain refractory and unruly spirits took great
       exception against the censure which the Bishop of Trèves, who was a legatus de latere from the
       Apostolic See, and the Patriarch of Venice has pronounced on Antonio degli Roselli of Arezzo and
       his book De Monarchia siue de potestate imperatoris, and since these rash men openly averred
       that the censure and condemnation of this work had not been brought about in any just or legal
       way, Fr. Henry was requested by Don Antoni de’ Pizamanni, a patrician of Venice, who was also a
       Doctor of Sacred Theology, to write a tractate impugning this said book of Antonio degli Roselli.
       Accordingly Fr. Kramer composed his opuscule with the following title:
                                                                   Page 7 of 8

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM

                      A NOTE UPON THE BIBLIOGRAPHY
            The Bibliography of the Malleus Maleficarum is extremely intricate and difficult, as many of
       the earlier editions both folio and quarto are without place or date. Thus the British Museum
       possesses a copy (Press-Mark 1 B, 1606), folio, which in the catalogue stands as “1485?”, but this
       can hardly be correct. The British Museum has five editions of the fifteenth century: 4to, 1490?
       (IA 8634); folio, 1490 (IB 8615); 4to, 1494 (IA 7468); folio, 1494 (IB 5064); 4to, 1496 (IA 7503).
            Graesse, Bibliotheca Magica, Leipzig, 1843, gives the editions of the fifteenth century as
       Nuremberg, both 4to and folio, 1494 and 1496. He also mentions an early folio and an early 4to
       without date or place. He further records a 4to published at Cologne in 1489, and a folio published
       at Cologne, 1494.
            Malleus Maleficarum, 8vo, Paris, an edition to which the British Museum catalogue assigns
       the date of “1510?”.
            Malleus Maleficarum, 8vo, “Colonie. Per me Henricü de Nussia,” 1511.
            Malleus Maleficarum, 8vo, Coloniae, J. Gymnicus, 1520. (Copies of these two Cologne
       editions are in the British Museum.)

       Salamandrae insigne. MD. LXXVI, 8vo. (This is a disappointing reprint, and it is difficult to see in
       what consisted the editorial care of the Servite Raffaelo Maffei, who may or may not have been
       some relation of the famous humanist of the same name (d. 25 January, 1522), and who was of the
       monastery of San Giacomo della Guidecca. He might have produced a critical edition of the
       greatest value, but as it is there are no glosses, there is no excursus, and the text is poor. For
       example, in a very difficult passage, Principalis Quaestio II, Pars II, where the earliest texts read
       “die dominico sotularia iuuenum fungia . . . perungunt,” Venice, 1576, has “die dominica sotularia
       iuuenum fungia . . . perungent.”)

       edition also contains in Vol. I extracts from Nider's Formicarius. Vol. II, which is dedicated to
       John Mündzenberg, Prior of the Carmelite House at Frankfort, contains the following nine
       Tractates:
            Bernard Basin, De artibus magicis. (1482.)
            Ulrich Molitor, De lamiis. (1489.)
            Girolamo Menghi, O.S.F.C., Flagellum Daemonum. (1578.)
            John Gerson, De probatione Spirituum. (circa 1404.)
            Thomas Murner, O.M., De Pythonico contractu. (1499.)
            Felix Hemmerlin, De exorcismis. (circa 1445.)
            Eiusdem, De credulitate Daemonibus adhibenda. (1454.)

            Eiusdem, Apologiae III aduersus Ioann. Franc. Ponzinibum. (1525.)
            The title-page announces that these works are “Omnes de integro nunc demum in ordinem
       congestos, notis & explicationibus illustratos, atque ab innumeris quibus ad nauseam usque
       scatebant mendis in usum communem uindicatos.” It is true that the earlier editions did swarm
       with errors, and some of these blemishes have been duly corrected, but there still remains much to
       be done in the way of emendation. It is to be wished that even the little care given to Vol. II had
       been bestowed on the text of the Malleus Maleficarum in Vol. I, for this is very poor and faulty.

       appear to be the latest edition of the Malleus Maleficarum, and the test has here and there received
       some revision. For example, in the passage to which reference has already been made, Principalis
       Quaestio II, Pars II, where the former reading was “sotularia iuuenum fungia . . . perungent,” we
       have the correct “axungia” instead of “fungia.” I have given in the Introduction a list of the
       collections contained in these four noble volumes.
            Quétif-Echard, Scriptores Ordinis Praedicatorum, 2 vols., Paris, 1719, Vol. I, p 881, mention
       a French translation of the Malleus Maleficarum, Le Maillet des Sorcières, as having been
       published, quarto, at Lyons by Stephanus Gueynard. No date, however, is given, and as this book
       cannot be traced, it seems highly probable that one of the many Lyons reprints of the Malleus
       Maleficarum was mistakenly supposed to be a French rendering of the original. In answer to my
       inquiries M. le Directeur of the Bibliothèque Nationale has kindly informed me: “L’ouvrage de
       Sprenger, Le Maillet des Sorcières, édition de Lyon, ne se trouve point à la Bibliothèque
       Nationale. Mais, de plus, je me suis reporté à l’excellente bibliographie lyonnaise de Baudrier, XIª
       série, 1914, et là non plus, l’édition de Stephanus Gueynard ne se trouve point.” Le Maillet des
       Sorcières, 4to, Lyons, by Stephanus Gueynard, does not occur in the valuable Essai d“une
       Bibliographis Franéaise mèthodique et raisonnée de la Sorcellerie of R. Yve-Plessis, Paris, 1900.

            In 1912 Oswald Weigel, the famous “Antiquariat & Auktions-Institut” of Leipzig, sold an
       exceptionally fine, if not - should it be once permissable to use a much over-looked word - a
       unique collection of books dealing with witchcraft. This library contained no fewer than
       twenty-nine exemplars of the Malleus Maleficarum, of which the dates were catalogues as follows:

           Jules Baissac, “Les grands Jours de la Sorcellerie,” 1890, p. 19, says - I do not know on what
        authority - “La 1re édition du ‘Malleus Maleficarum’ est de 1489, in - 4, Cologne, cinq ans après
        la publication de la Bulle Summis desiderantes.”

           1433-77. In 1467 he succeeded to the Dukedom of Burgundy on the death of his father, Philip
        the Good.



           Alanus de Rupe, born about 1428; died at Zwolle in Holland, 8 September, 1475. Early in life
        he entered the Dominican Order, and after a distinguished academic career, preached throughout
        Northern France, Flanders, and the Netherlands with intensest enthusiasm, his special mission
        being the re-establishment everywhere of the Holy Rosary. His vision of the Rosary is generally
        assigned to the year 1460. The “Petite Année Dominicaine” (Rome, 1911, p. 309) says: “Il fut le
        grand prédicateur des vertus de la T.-Ste-Vierge au XVe siècle et le restaurateur du St. Rosaire.
        Car . . . une dévotion si rationelle, si facile, si attrayante, si utile, inaugerée par un aussi grand
        saint que Dominique était tombée presque partout dans l’oubli. Alains se mit à l’æuvre . . . faisant
        renaître avec la culture du Rosaire, les fruits de grâce. . . . Sa mort était celle d’un saint, et son
        tombeau devint glorieux par de nombreux miracles. Un autel lui était dédié dans le couvent de
        Dinan, et le B. Grignon de Montefort aimait à y dire la messe.”



           The legati a latere are cardinals set by the Pope on extraordinary missions or as temporary
        representatives.



           The Archbishop Rupprecht von der Pfalz (1463-80) was forcibly pressing his rights as temporal
        lord, an action which gave rise to considerable violence and much fighting throughout the
        territory.



           The Devotion itself was revealed by Our Lady to S. Dominic. Although perhaps no actual
        Confraternities had been granted indulgences before 1475-6, yet there were Dominican Guilds
        and Fraternities which foster this Crown of Prayers.



           In 1486 a priest in London writes to his patron in Yorkshire: “I send a paper of the Rosary of
        Our Lady of Coleyn, and I have registered your name with both my Ladis names, as the paper
        expresses, and ye be acopled as brethren and sisters.” “Plumpton Correspondence” (Camden
        Society, p. 50).



           Later authorities say Zwolle in Holland.



           Michel François de l’Isle, O.P., Bishop of Selymria, born circa 1435; died 2 June, 1502. In
        1488 this famous theologian was Regent of Studies at Cologne. An ample biography may be found

        Sprenger may be found in his “Bibliotheca Ordinis Praedicatorum.” He is called “of Siena”
        because of his great devotion to S. Catherine of Siena.

        19 October, 1640. He wa a canon of Antwerp Cathedral, and in 1624 he became Dean of the
        chapter and Vicar-general of the diocese. He has left thirty-nine vast works on profane,
        ecclesiastical, and monastic history. See De Riddler's “Aubert Le Mire, sa vie, sas écrits,

           Louis-Ellies Dupin, born 17 June, 1657; died 6 June, 1719. He wrote at great length upon the
        Fathers, many of whose works he edited with commentaries. Some of his statements involved him
        in disputes with Dom. Petit-Didier and later with Bossuet. Dupin is an extremely prolific author,
        but several of his propsitions were regarded as suspect in orthodoxy.

        see of Dalmatia.

           It is remarkable that at the very moment similar controversies are raised about the Blessed
        Sacrament. The words “Real Presence” are freely bandied. This is a popular phrase, since it may
        mean anything or nothing. It is far better to save all ambiguity, and to say, “The Blessed
        Sacrament is God.” One writer, professing himself a Christian, declares that it is at least doubtful
        whether Our Lord instituted The Holy Sacrifice of the Altar. This, of course, is tantamount to a
        denial of Christ.



           It must suffice to mention only a few of the many Saints who have seen Our Lord in the Blessed
        Sacrament. S. Veronica of Binasco, the Augustinian, saw Him there with her bodily eyes, whilst
        the Host was environed by adoring Angels. Vaulem the Cistercian saw in the Host the Infant Jesus,
        Who held a crown of gold adorned with precious stones. When Peter of Toulouse was holding the
        Host over the chalice at Mass the Bambino of marvellous beauty appeared between his fingers.
        The same thing happened every morning for two or three months. Similarly Our Lord was seen by
        S. Angela of Flogno; S. Hugh of Cluny; S. Lydwine; S. Ignatius; S. Joseph of Cupertino; Domenica
        of Paradise; Teresa de la Cerda, O.S.D., who saw the Infant Jesus lying on the corporal; and very
        many more. S. Catherine of Siena saw Our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament under different forms,
        and at the fraction of the Host she saw how He remained entired in each part. Mary of Oignies at
        the elevation in Passion-Tide saw Our Lord upon the Cross; at Christmas Our Lady appeared in
        the Host carrying the Infant Jesus in her arms. In the Cathedral at Orvieto I have venerated the
        Corporale which is stained with blood that fell from the Host when a young priest who doubted
        was saying Mass. This happened in the days of Pope Urban IV, who reigned 1261-64.



           This can hardly be correct.

                                 THE
                         MALLEUS MALEFICARUM

                         INTRODUCTION TO 1928 EDITION
             3. Here beginneth a Tractate confuting the errors of Master Antonio degli Roselli of Padua,
       jurisconsult, concerning the plenary power of the Supreme Pontiff and the power of a temporal
       monarch. The conclusion is as follows: Here endeth the Reply of the Inquisitor-General of
       Germany, Fr. Henry Kramer, in answer to the erroneous and mistaken opinions of Antonio degli
       Roselli. Printed at Venice, at the Press of Giacomo de Lencho, at the charge of Peter Liechtenstein,
       27 July, 1499.
             4. The Shield of Defence of the Holy Roman Church against the Picards and Waldenses. This
       was published when Fr. Kramer was acting as Censor of the Faith under Alexander VI in Bohemia
       and Moldavia. This work is praised by the famous Dominican writer Noel Alexandre in his Selecta
       historiae ecclesiasticae capita et in loca eiusdem insignia dissertationes historicae, criticae,
       dogmaticae. In dealing with the fifteenth century he quotes passages from this work. The
       bibliographer Beugheim catalogues an edition of this work among those Incunabula the exact date
       of which cannot be traced. Georg Simpler, who was Rector of the University of Pforzheim, and
       afterwards Professor of Jurisprudence of Tubingen in the early decades of the sixteenth century,
       also mentions this work with commendation. Odorico Rinaldi quotes from this work in his Annales
       under the year 1500. The Sermons of 1496 are highly praised by Antony of Siena, O.P. Antonius
       Possevinus, S.J., speaks of a treatise Against the Errors of Witches. This I have never seen, but I
       feel very well assured that it is no other work than the Malleus Maleficarum, which was written in
       collaboration with Fr. James Sprenger, and which we have spoken above in some detail.
             In what year Fr. Henry Kramer died and to what house of the Order he was then attached is
       not recorded, but it seems certain that he was living at least as late as 1500.
             Thus Quétif-Echard, but we may not impertinently add a few, from several, formal references
       which occur in Dominican registers and archives. James Sprenger was born at Basel (he is called
       de Basilea in a MS. belonging to the Library of Basel), probably about 1436038, and he was
       admitted as a Dominican novice in 1452 at the convent of his native town. An extract “ex
       monumentis contuent. Coloniens.” says that Sprenger “beatus anno 1495 obiit Argentinae ad S.
       Nicolaum in Undis in conuentu sororum ordinis nostri.” Another account relates that he did not die
       at Strasburg on 6 December, 1495, but at Verona, 3 February, 1503, and certainly Jacobus
       Magdalius in his Stichologia has “In mortem magistri Iacobi Sprenger, sacri ordinis praedicatorii
       per Theutoniam prouincialis, Elegia,” which commences:
              O utinam patrio recubassent ossa sepulchro
              Quae modo Zenonis urbe sepulta iacent.

       Henry Kramer, who appears in the Dominican registers as “Fr. Henricus Institoris de Sletstat,” was
       born about 1430. His later years were distinguished by the fervour of his apostolic missions in
       Bohemia, where he died in 1505.
             Although, as we have seeb, Fr. Henry Kramer and Fr. James Sprenger were men of many
       activities, it is by the Malleus Maleficarum that they will chiefly be remembered. There can be no
       doubt that this work had in its day and for a full couple of centuries an enormous influence. There
       are few demonologists and writers upon witchcraft who do not refer to its pages as an ultimate
       authority. It was continually quoted and appealed to in the witch-trials of Germany, France, Italy,
       and England; whilst the methods and examples of the two Inquisitors gained an even more
       extensive credit and sanction owing to their reproduction (sometimes without direct
       acknowledgement) in the works of Bedin, De Lancre, Boguet, Remy, Tartarotti, Elich, Grilland,
       Pons, Godelmann, de Moura, Oberlal, Cigogna, Peperni, Martinus Aries, Anania, Binsfeld,
       Bernard Basin, Menghi, Stampa, Clodius, Schelhammer, Wolf, Stegmann, Neissner, Voigt,
       Cattani, Ricardus, and a hundred more. King James has drawn (probably indirectly) much of his
       Daemonologie, in Forme of a Dialogue, Divided into three Bookes from the pages of the Malleus;
       and Thomas Shadwell, the Orance laureate, in his “Notes upon the Magick” of his famous play,
       The Lancashire Witches, continually quotes from the same source.
             To some there may seem much in the Malleus Maleficarum that is crude, much that is
       difficult. For example, the etymology will provoke a smile. The derivation of Femina from fe
       minus is notorious, and hardly less awkward is the statement that Diabolus comes “a Dia, quod est
       duo, et bolus, quod est morsellus; quia duo occidit, scilicet corpus et animam.” Yet I venture to say
       that these blemishes - such gross blunders, of you will - do not affect the real contexture and
       weight of this mighty treatise.
             Possibly what will seem even more amazing to modern readers is the misogynic trend of
       various passages, and these not of the briefest nor least pointed. However, exaggerated as these
       may be, I am not altogether certain that they will not prove a wholesome and needful antidote in
       this feministic age, when the sexes seem confounded, and it appear to be the chief object of many
       females to ape the man, an indecorum by which they not only divest themselves of such charm as
       they might boast, but lay themselves open to the sternest reprobation in the name of sanity and
       common-sense. For the Apostle S. Peter says: “Let wives be subject to their husbands: that if any
       believe not the word, they may be won without the word, by the conversation of the wives,
       considering your chaste conversation with fear. Whose adorning let it not be the outward plaiting
       of the hair, or the wearing of god, or the putting on of apparel; but the hidden man of the heart is
       the incorruptibility of a quiet and meek spirit, which is rich in the sight of God. For after the
       manner heretofore the holy women also, who trusted God, adorned themselves, being in subjection
       to their own husbands: as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, doing
       well, and not fearing any disturbance.”
             With regard to the sentences pronounced upon witches and the course of their trials, we may
       say that these things must be considered in reference and in proportion to the legal code of the age.
       Modern justice knows sentences of the most ferocious savagery, punishments which can only be
       dealt out by brutal vindictiveness, and these are often meted out to offences concerning which we
       may sometimes ask ourselves whether they are offences at all; they certainly do no harm to
       society, and no harm to the person. Witches were the bane of all social order; they injured not only
       persons but property. They were, in fact, as has previously been emphasized, the active members
       of a vast revolutionary body, a conspiracy against civilization. Any other save the most thorough
       measures must have been unavailing; worse, they must have but fanned the flame.
             And so in the years to come, when the Malleus Maleficarum was used as a standard
       text-book, supremely authoritative practice winnowed the little chaff, the etymologies, from the
       wheat of wisdom. Yet it is safe to say that the book is to-day scarcely known save by name. It has
       become a legend. Writer after writer, who had never turned the pages, felt himself at liberty to
       heap ridicule and abuse upon this venerable volume. He could quote - though he had never seen
       the text - an etymological absurdity or two, or if in more serious vein he could prate glibly enough
       of the publication of the Malleus Maleficarum as a “most disastrous episode.” He did not know
       very clearly what he meant, and the humbug trusted that nobody would stop to inquire. For the
       most part his confidence was respected; his word was taken.
             We must approach this great work - admirable in spite of its triffling blemishes - with open
       minds and grave intent; if we duly consider the world of confusion, of Bolshevism, of anarchy and
       licentiousness all around to-day, it should be an easy task for us to picture the difficulties, the
       hideous dangers with which Henry Kramer and James Sprenger were called to combat and to cope;
       we must be prepared to discount certain plain faults, certain awkwardnesses, certain roughness and
       even severities; and then shall we be in a position dispassionately and calmy to pronounce opinion
       upon the value and the merit of this famouse treatise.
             As for myself, I do not hesitate to record my judgement. Literary merits and graces, strictly
       speaking, were not the aim of the authors of the Malleus Maleficarum, although there are felicities
       not a few to be found in their admirable pages. Yet I dare not even hope that the flavour of Latinity
       is preserved in a translation which can hardly avoid being jejune and bare. The interest, then, lies
       in the subject-matter. And from this point of view the Malleus Maleficarum is one of the most
       pregnant and most interesting books I know in the library of its kind - a kind which, as it deals
       with eternal things, the eternal conflict of good and evil, must eternally capture the attention of all
       men who think, all who see, or are endeavouring to see, reality beyond the accidents of matter,
       time, and space.

NOTA - To Dr. H.J. Norma I wish to express my grateful thanks for his kindness in having read through the proofs of the
 Malleus Maleficarum. Those who realize the labour and sacrifice of time such a task demands will best appreciate the
                                     value of such generous assistance. - M.S.

           The extremer Picards seem to have been an offshoot of the Behgards and to have professed the
        Adamite heresy. They called their churches Paradise whilst engaged in common worship stripped
        themselves quite nude. Shameful disorders followed. A number of these fanatics took possession of
        an island in the river Nezarka and lived in open communism. In 1421 Ziska, the Hussite leader,
        practically exterminated the sect. There have, however, been sporadic outbreaks of these
        Neo-Adamites. Picards was also a name given to the “Bohemian Brethren,” who may be said to
        have been organized in 1457 by Gregory, the nephew of Rokyzana. They held very extreme views,
        denying that the Blessed Sacrament is the Body of Christ, advocating the abolition of all
        disctinctions of rank and fortune and the living in community. In the course of time these views
        were practically modified, and to-day they may be said to be represented by the Moravian Body.



           Reigned from 11 August, 1492, to 18 August, 1503.



           Born at Rouen 19 January, 1639; he entered the Dominican Order in that city, 9 May, 1655.
        His literary labours were very vast, and in 1677 he published at Paris the first volume of his huge
        “History.” Some passages were very sharply criticized, and even censured, but in the preface to
        the third edition (aris, 1699, 8 volumes, folio) the author, whilst fully submitting to the Holy See,
        tactfully defends himself. He died of old age in the convent of S. Jacques at Paris, 21 August, 1724.



           Oratorian, born at Treviso, 1595; died at Rome, 22 January, 1671. This eminent historian
        occupied himself with the continuation of the “Annales” of the Ven Cesare Baronio, and his work,
        which covers the years from 1198 to 1565, was published at Rome, 1646-77.

           S. Zeno, Martyr, is the Patron of Verona, in which city a basilica, San Zenone, is dedicated in
        his honour. His feast is kept 12 April, and the Roman Martyrology tells us that he was a Bishop of
        Verona, put to death under the Emperor Gallienus.

        September) of 1681.

                                THE
                        MALLEUS MALEFICARUM
                                 Summation of the Malleus Maleficarum by Edo Nyland.

             The Dominican monks Heinrich Kramer and James Sprenger assembled many fairy
       tales and magic stories, nightmares, hearsay, confessions and accusations and put this all
       together as factual information in what became the handbook for the witch hunters,
       examiners, torturers and executioners, called the Malleus Maleficarum, a title which was
       translated as Hammer of Witches. It was published in 1487, but two years previously the
       authors had secured a bull from Pope Innocent VIII, authorizing them to continue the witch
       hunt in the Alps which they had already instituted against the opposition from clergy and
       secular authorities. They reprinted the bull of December 5, 1484 to make it appear that the
       whole book enjoyed papal sanction.
             Anybody with a grudge or suspicion, very young children included, could accuse
       anyone of witchcraft and be listened to with attention; anyone who wanted someone else's
       property or wife could accuse; any loner, any old person living alone, anyone with a
       misformity, physical or mental problem was likely to be accused. Open hunting season was
       declared on women, especially herb gatherers, midwives, widows and spinsters. Women
       who had no man to supervise them were of course highly suspicious. It has been estimated
       by Dr. Marija Gimbutas, professor of archaeology at the University of California, that as
       many as 9 million people, overwhelmingly women, were burned or hanged during the
       witch-craze. For nearly 250 years the Witches' Hammer was the guidebook for the witch
       hunters, but again some of the inquisitioners had misgivings about this devilish book. In a
       letter dated November 27, 1538 Salazar advised the inquisitioners not to believe everything
